My name is Kwadwo. My friends call me KayO.  
I love AI & Software Engineering.  

I've been running two blogs for a few years now:
- [Chopbox Life](https://chopboxlife.com/): A fictional blog based just in part on my life in high school.
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@kayogh): My Medium blog is dedicated to things that are a little more real and have to do with life.

I figured it's time to move my more techy posts off Medium and unto Github, because why not? ðŸ¤·

I guess that's all you need to know. Feel free to look around and let me know your thoughts.
