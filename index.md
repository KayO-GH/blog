I've been running two blogs for a few years now:
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://chopboxlife.com/">Chopbox Life</a>: A fictional blog based just in part on my life in high school.</li>
    <li><a href="https://medium.com/@kayogh">Medium</a>: My Medium blog is dedicated to things that are a little more real and have to do with life.</li>
</ol>

I figured it's time to move my more techy posts off Medium and unto Github, because why not? ðŸ¤·

<br/>
I guess that's all you need to know. Feel free to look around and let me know your thoughts.
