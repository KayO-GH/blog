The decision was an easy one… mixed school. I mean, why would I want to go to a boys school? Really, what good could come of seeing just guys everyday, all day, for four whole years?! Yes! four years, not three.

The year was 2009. Atta-Mills was the president of Ghana, “pure water” cost 10 pesewas, and I’d written 10 subjects in my BECE. Come to think of it, I actually went to JSS, not JHS… darn it, I’m old.

So yeah, I went to high school for four years… four years of bitter-sweet memory-making… but I’m jumping the gun. The point is, I chose Motown because I wanted to go to school with girls (no, I’m not some “girl-gbee”), and no matter what anyone says, Motown is the best mixed school in Ghana. Yeah, I said it! Bite me!

But on the real, I knew mixed school would be the “ish”. I knew believed there was (at least statistically) a lower chance of meeting murderous seniors or sodomizing perverts on account of the gender balance. Let’s pretend for now that I was right.

And so blissfully I entered Motown for the first time one sunny September afternoon with my dad for Freshmen’s Orientation. We drove past Guggisberg (G-berg) house and Gyamfi house to the Aggrey chapel, a beautiful building with stone walls. Come and see! I knew paa that I’d made a good decision. You see the houses I mentioned were nice oo, they gave me a nice feeling about the school, but at the chapel… 😅 Kaishh!! What had these girls been eating during the BECE break?! These were soooo not the small girls I’d gone through basic school with. I mean, let me be realistic, of course some of them were smallish, but puberty had graduated a few people. If my dad discerned the foolish reason for my excitement, he certainly didn’t show it, and I didn’t volunteer any information either… I was foolish, not crazy.

One chaplain came to speak first. He seemed pleasant. Next was the senior housemaster. His real name was soon forgotten, but his student-given name stuck like a tongue to a frozen metal saucepan: “J-Poons” it was.

“Good day, parentsh and shtudentshh. In factch, you are very fortchunate to be shelectched into thish shchool were many many many of our preshidents have been trained.” You get the point, J-Poons spoke funny. And it didn’t help… it reeeeally didn’t help, that he was dark as night. Some dared to call him names like “Anadwo” and “Dark and Lovely”. Not me. Like I said, I was foolish, not mad.

If you listened carefully though, you could hear the stifled laughter coming from different places in the chapel. Me sef, e lef small, I wanted to ROTFL. But hard guy no dey do yawa.

J-Poons ended his speech with a half-sinister smile on his face, “Remember that your parentshh will be leaving you with ushh” * dramatic pause * “We are looking forward to having you to ourshelvsh until the year two thousand and thirtcheen”. He actually mentioned the whole “two thousand and thirteen”.

Wait! What?! The sudden realization of the implications of four years in boarding school hit me so hard in the next 5 seconds. I bet I would have turned pale if I was fair. But like I said, hard guy – I played it cool. The guy sitting next to me begun to cave in under the same realization. “Mommy, I don’t want to go”, he begged his mum.

Puh-lease, “mommy???”, ma guy, ma guy, grow a pair. Is it in public that you’ll act like a kindergartner? But of course I said all this in my head… my dad knew I still called my mum “mommy”. Hehehe.

The headmistress was up next, quickly followed by her 3 assistants. A chill swept through the room. Four principals??… and nobody warned me? Chale, it’s not my fault, I just have this aversion towards school authorities. They can be really… creepy. “But no wahala”, I consoled myself, “Motown entertainment go pap”. Such a stupid mantra, right? Someone’s mantra later on was “Ahiaa, you can’t grind in Botwe.” For real, some guys set their priorities using their own twisted metrics. You’d think they think with a head different from the one that sits on their necks.

A few moments later, we were at the administration building to find out which house I’d been assigned. Aggrey House. It sounded cool, but I wouldn’t see it today, daddy my dad had somewhere to go.

Aggrey House would meet Kodzo in a week…

It’s when you see your prospectus that it actually dawns on you that this is happening… you are actually going to school. You’ll buy a chopbox, trunk, mattress, exercise books, provisions, sew khaki trousers and shorts, buy white shirts, shoes, sandals… all manner of wearables and eatables. Typically, when you’re a guy, you’ll forget about your soap, toothpaste, deodorant, etc, but that is what mothers are for. Mommy handled those things like a pro. You see, my big brother had been the lab rat three years earlier when he was going to high school; sucks to be a firstborn sometimes… just sometimes. Mommy had gained experience now, and I barely lifted a finger.

By 2pm my dad and I were driving into Motown. We took the second gate this time, close to the Achimota hospital – my dad had been told that was the easier route to Aggrey House. We drove past Lugard house where the boys in light blue live, they had nice lawns… we drove past Livingstone house where the guys in yellow live, they had nice lawns too, and a makeshift football pitch, but it looked like it got the job done. Finally, finally, we got to Aggrey house. Drumroll please…

Let me interject here. The Aggrey House you’ll see if you go to Motown today is not the Aggrey House I met in 2009. Thank God for progress! That place they took me to ehnn…

All the grass was dead. ALL OF IT. They had one-third of a pavement in front of the house. Yes, one-third. Like someone had started constructing a pavement to impress us or something, and then decided we weren’t worth the effort after all. But that didn’t kill me as much as the next thing I’m about to tell you. See oo, there were (mental count) 1-2-3-4-5-6-7, yes seven water tanks in that house… 4 Rambo 1000’s and 3 smaller polytanks… BUT!! The taps did not flow!!! I was confused. Motown… presidential school… taps not flowing. Ah! But this Aggrey House was Kwame Nkrumah’s house oo.

Hmph! Let me relax a little… I even skipped some details.

So we pulled up in front of the house. Some parents and some of my fellow newbies were gathered in front of a table with three people sitting behind it; one really short man and two boys. A group of students came up to the car and greeted, “Daddy, good afternoon. Can we help with your stuff?”

My father was impressed… I was not fooled. These guys were just happy to carry my chopbox in anticipation of “kwahyeeing“* me later. I noted their faces. They didn’t look too bright. I’d handle them.

As I was about to step out of the car,  my dad said, “Twɛn” (wait). Oh nooooo! Not the advice! Not here too! I sighed, “Yes Da.”

    Him: “I know you are a smart boy.”

    Me (in my head): You do, do you? [nods]

    Him: “I know you’ll study hard.”

    Me (still in my head): That makes one of us. [nods again]

    Him: “I need a favor from you.”

    Me: “Okay?”

    Him: “Errrm, can you come on the National Science and Math Quiz for me?”

If ever I’ve had mixed feelings, it was this day. I was touched… this man believed in me. But at the same time, I almost burst out laughing. Me… brilla boy? Did those people have lives? Did he really believe I could rub shoulders with those ultra-nerds? This man paaaahnn. What he didn’t know was that by raising his expectations in me he had inadvertently cut in half all the foolishness I’d planned to execute now that I wouldn’t be living under his roof. This was very possibly the moment in which I was saved from becoming the womanizer I’d envisioned myself to be in my fantasies. Aren’t God’s ways strange?

Ladies, and gentlemen, how I kept my face under control, I don’t know. But with the most serious of expressions, I replied, “Yes Da, I’ll try”. That answer seemed to satisfy him. Good. He would give me extra money for motivation, but before that he had to spoil the excellent mood he had built up, “And don’t follow girls! You hear me? They are dangerous! Your mother and I have brought you here to learn, not to become a father. Do you hear me?!”

Oh, my old boy. Can’t live with him, can’t live without him.

We were quickly out of the car and in front of the table with the short man. Smizzle, they called him. He was the housemaster. Smizzle was short (get it?) for “Short Man Devil”. We’ll stick with Smizzle.

I was already tall at 14. I didn’t have to be tall to be taller than Smizzle though. But I learnt three key lessons early in my adolescence, after my first growth spurt:

    1. If you’ll laugh at a short person, make sure he/she is already your friend.

    2. Laugh at them to their face, not behind their back.

    3. When in doubt, refer to memes.

Smizzle was neither my friend nor my age mate. I wasn’t about to be a funny man. Besides, the two boys next to him – the house prefects – they looked like they could really bring on the meanness.

“Yes. Please, what’s your name?”, the first house prefect asked. “Senior, please, Kodzo Ametewee-Nutakor”, I replied. “My name is not senior”, he retorted. “Sorry senior – ei, sorry sir – ei, please, what should I call you?”. Ow chale, golden-tongued boy like me paa, see my childish first impression. The guy seemed amused. “We’ll introduce ourselves later” was his reply. Smizzle scanned through a notebook, and introduced himself with these words, “Fifty cedis”.

“Pardon me”, was dad replied.

“Fifty cedis”, he repeated.

“For?”, my old boy prodded.

“House development fund. We have a lot of renovations to do, mmm.”

Daddy is not the kind of person to roll his eyes, else he woul dhave. He’s a smart man, so he did not expose the thickness of his wallet. “Junior, give him the money”, he said to me, “I’ll replace it”.

Smizzle took the money, pointed at my things, and declared, “C-Dorm”. It seemed the intended audience had not heard the declaration. Smizzle shouted, “Hey!” at a bunch of students and pointed at my things again. The students rushed for the trunk like demons for a lost soul. “Where to?”, they asked. “Dorm C”, I replied. A smirk stole across the first house prefect’s face. “C-Dorm”, he corrected me, “follow them”.

I obeyed.

Most houses in Motown have 4 dorms, A to D. C-Dorm is upstairs. I picked a bed next to a window. After my dad left I lay on the bed and looked outside, then I looked around and really took the room in.

Juniors were in the outer chamber, seniors in the inner chamber. Seniors were the only ones allowed to eat in the dorms, or keep their chopboxes in the dorms – the rest of us had to keep our chopboxes in a “Chopbox Room”. Downstairs! That one kraa didn’t pain me like the fact that this chopbox room had a padlock. Who told you my food needs protection?! It has it’s own lock you obsessive micromanagers!!! But I understood soon enough; the room had a padlock to keep my chopbox away from me 😥, not to protect the box.

C-Dorm, like the other three had wooden floors, and the walls were painted a creamy shade of yellow at the top and blue at the bottom. This would be home for the next four years? Didn’t seem so ba-

BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! “All form one boys should get downstairs by the end of my tenth count!!”

“Teeeeeeeeehhhhn!”

“Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine!!”…

Ermmm, what I was saying? This was going to be one heck of a long and bumpy ride.

“Who fly the bolus?!”

Silence.

“I said, who threw the kenkey?”

More silence.

Obodai stole a glance in my direction. “Adey beg”, I mouthed.

“All of you, follow me”.

We silently marched behind him to our doom. They’d all pay for my mistake.

Believe it or not, this is the story of how I initially became friends with my best friend, Obodai. But we have to start at the beginning.

The first week of high school is never an accurate representation of what to expect. It’s called the grace period, and for good reason: grace abounds. You can get away with almost anything. The whole idea is that during that week you have the legal right to use the statement “I didn’t know” whenever you are caught committing an offence… and you WILL be caught committing an offence, even if you are Angel Obi… ei, Mother Theresa.

You think I’m lying? Look, if you attended a high school with more rules than the Motown I attended, then you didn’t go to school – you went to jail… for three months at a time, three times every year, you were an inmate especially in Opoku Ware where they give you prison numbers. Don’t insult me, I’m writing this while hungry. But back to the matter at hand, Motown is one of those schools with the “mother rule”. Maybe you’ve heard it before:

    A breach of common sense is a breach of school rules.

Personally, I believed it was just a means for seniors to constantly have silly reasons to punish you. And my theory was soon proved right.

That first week, you should have seen us… untouchable boys and girls in our oversized uniforms, enjoying grace period like there was no next week. That is, until…

We worked like slaves, running errands and doing filthy chores. We were always sleep-deprived, mentally exhausted and hungry. The first two, we could adapt to – call it “growth” – but who in their right minds adapted to hunger? We sought solace from our chopboxes, but after two weeks of being kwahyéed, the boxes had nothing more to give.

Remember the guy-guy house prefect from the last episode? His name was Eben. That dude could turn a blind eye to make Stevie Wonder wonder. (See what I did there?). His mates were literally robbing us. They ate more from our chopboxes than we did. I thought mixed school would be good… silly me, I’d forgotten that the houses were not mixed. Eben didn’t do anything to save us. We were on our own, with empty chopboxes, and only the dining hall to look forward to.

D-Hall food was never enough. But it kept us alive. Besides, by Ghanaian high school standards, Motown’s D-hall food was considered nice. Also, it was a great place to socialize with the girls who were not in your class. Especially the ‘dadaba’ ones on your table who didn’t eat much so you could get second helpings. We were starving child labourers; we couldn’t let anything come between us and our food.

And that is exactly what got me into trouble… food.

Here’s how it went down.

One day, after washing a pile of dirty laundry, I was looking for my last gari to eat (and maybe die) like that widow Elijah met in the Bible. All of a sudden, this senior, “M.O.B.” they called him, walked up to me and went like, “Chale, make I see your box inside”. Legally, he hadn’t yet kwahyéed me… plus if I refused I’d get ganged up on by the other seniors, and he’d tell Smizzle he was conducting an inspection and I wasn’t cooperating. So I obliged.

Like I said, it was my laaaaast gari oo. I was preparing my laaaaaast soakings… but this guy pointed at my laaaaaast tin of milk and said, “Make I feel you”. The impudence! Make you feel what?!

“Oh, M.O.B. adey beg, ma laaaaaast this”. As soon as the words were out of my mouth I knew I’d messed up.

He smiled a cruel smile as he said, “Are you speaking pidgin with me?”.

Speaking pidgin was technically an offense, although everyone did it.

“Ow, please, I’m sorry. It was a slip of tongue…”

Oh chale, hard guy like me, begging like some wuss. The guy did not even listen. Truth is, he had played me. It was an expertly crafted checkmate. Either he got the milk or I got a punishment. Stubborn Ewe man that I am, I wasn’t about to punk out. “Sorry, I cannot give you this tin of milk”, I reiterated in perfect English, signing my death warrant.

“OK, no yawa, go carry scrubbing brush”, was his response. It was almost funny, except it was not; this guy was going to make me scrub the bathroom… because I wouldn’t give him my last tin of milk. Ei, ewiase.

Suddenly, like a melody from heaven, the highest authority in the land – the school bell, rang. M.O.B. cussed. It was time for supper. According to Smizzle’s most recent rules he had to let me go. Of course, I’d scrub later that night, but for the next hour or so he was the jerk who failed to get my milk. I high-tailed it out of the chopbox room, threw on my prep attire and rushed to the D-hall. We were going to have kenkey, AKA bolus… not my favourite, but your boy was hungry.

Now back in 2009, unpredictable power outages (dumsor) were the norm. Also, if the lights went off during dining, the dining hall suddenly became a war-zone. Food would fly everywhere. Students are just crazy like that. On this particular day, I sat with the rest of the Aggrey form one boys, waiting patiently for the senior prefect to ring the bell so we could start eating. I saw M.O.B. enter the dining hall. He walked to the Aggrey form 3’s table, table B3, close to the high table where the prefects sat. My blood just boiled. Ah! Did my mother give me the milk for the two of us? The rage I felt scared even me.

All of a sudden… darkness.

One of the Kingsley girls screamed (they scream at everything), jolting me out of my thoughts… dumsor! I really wish adrenaline and rage had cooperated with my better judgement that evening. Before I could stop myself I had grabbed two bolus(es) from the pan… (Ah, wait… if the plural of radius is radii, shouldn’t the plural of bolus be bolii? Food for thought 🤔). I grabbed 2 bolii and threw them as hard as I could in the direction of the last place I had seen M.O.B. What was I thinking?!

People screamed, people ducked… suddenly, light! It was all over so fast. I looked in the direction of table B3. The mess I saw ehnn, I froze… I’d missed M.O.B., but what I’d hit was the real problem. I don’t know where one of my projectiles went but the second had hit the bowl of pepper on table B3 and painted the Aggrey seniors red. So maybe I wasn’t such a bad shot, after all, M.O.B. was covered in pepper too. The rest were casualties of war. They were all in shock… all except Eben. For someone who was always turning a blind eye, why was it today of all days that he saw where the bolus was thrown from? And why was he not sitting on the high table like any normal prefect? Why, oh why did he have to get caught up in this?

He walked calmly, too calmly, to our table and asked, “Who fly the bolus?”. Silence.

“I said, who threw the kenkey?”. More silence.

Obodai, a guy from A-Dorm, stole a glance in my direction. He’d seen me! Would he snitch?

“Adey beg”, I mouthed.

He nodded ever so slightly and I breathed a sigh of relief… he wasn’t a snitch, plus I think he approved of my shot. Call me selfish, but I wasn’t going to sacrifice myself for everyone. Jesus’ sacrifice was enough. That one sef, see the way they lashed Him.

“All of you, follow me”, Eben grunted.

We were dead.

Are you familiar with the term disco-weeding? No? What about disco-scrubbing? Let me fill you in. Back in Motown, in ’09, any activity prefixed with “disco” was done in the night. So if you’re disco-weeding, you’re swinging a really sharp machete about in the dark, hoping to hit weeds and not your foot. That’s how our punishment started… We were exempted from going to prep that night. We spent that time weeding… IN THE DARK!

After prep, when the seniors returned, there was mass stretching. If you don’t know what that is, well, the executive summary is that we were beaten by 16 angry seniors who had to change their prep attires on account of pepper… smaaaaaall pepper I poured on them oo. Then we were made to wash the soiled clothes, and afterwards, 2 full hours of disco-scrubbing. We slept at midnight.

This was the first day.

The next morning, at 4:30am, we did not hear a normal rising bell. Eben sounded the rising bell himself. Completely unheard of! This is how it went:

BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! “Announcement!! From now until the weekend, Aggrey house is declared to be in a state of military rule!!”. The words that followed were spoken casually, but almost like a threat, “Live like Jesus.”

The look of horror on the faces of the form 2 boys indicated that I had caused more harm than anyone had bargained for. I turned to one of them, Rokotoo, they called him, “Chale, Roks, what be this ‘military rule’ thing?” His response was unsettling, not because of what he said, but because of the way he said it, “This week, no senior be your friend. Them go mafia everybody.”

Ah, so kyerɛsɛ, they hadn’t even been showing us their worst all this time? I no go lie, I almost pissed my pants… but hard guy no dey do yawa.

“What kraa dem go fit do?”, I asked.

“Wait and see” came the reply, “but paa, if I catch that gyimii boy he fly the bolus ehnn, the way I go die am!”

This time I almost sharted.

“Oh, hmmm, meanwhile too, boys dey talk say e be Gyamfi boy he fly am oo”, I offered.

Roks just walked away breathing threats.

Military rule was hell. The wickedness I saw that week ehnn, you’d have to be Lord Voldemort to be any meaner. Chale, we were actually punished for things like not sleeping in our pajamas during the afternoon rest hour. The chopbox room, sustainer of sanity, was locked throughout the week. When the bell rang for dining, we were literally given 30 seconds to vacate the house; you should have seen people running out of the house in singlets and boxer shorts. We had cutlery inspections, trunk inspections, bed inspections, handkerchief inspections… anything which provided an excuse to get you punished was used.

Some people, like Roks, were also investigating, trying to find the “bolus launcher”, AKA me. To others, I was a hero… the masked vigilante who stood up to the seniors in stealth mode. I felt like Spiderman… no, Batman. Yeah, I felt like Batman. And Obodai was Alfred, my butler, the only one who knew my true identity.

Needless to say, we survived military rule. It is not something to wish on anyone, not even your enemies. Seemingly, as a reward for enduring to the end, Saturday came… and with Saturday comes entertainment. It was Records Night. “Records Night” (Recs Night for short) is a Motown term. It has other names in other places: “Jams” and “Soloku” to name a few. Basically, it’s a lust-fest of boys and girls packed into a very hot assembly hall with loud music and people dancing body-to-body like their lives depend on it.

The excitement in the school was almost tangible. Come and see C-Dorm boys polishing their shoes, ironing their shirts… wearing two pairs of briefs in anticipation of nsɛmbɔne. If only the girls knew the plans some guys had for them: plans of evil and not of good, to alter their expected end.

At 6:30pm all roads led to the assembly hall – a large old building. The music was always loud with the bass turned all the way up so that you felt every note in your bones. Those were the days of “Wengeze”; Sarkodie’s rap songs still had some sense back then; Rick Ross was still fat and “jerking” was the dance of the day.

Now I have to be honest, my body no be firewood oo… but chale, call me kriifé (bolus flying aside), call me jon, maybe it was my dad’s advice, whatever, but I just didn’t have it in me to screech—that’s what they called the body-to-body dancing—at these kinds of things. I still don’t. Like the adwenfi alone will kill me. So to make sure that I was not a victim of “improper” dreams and wild imaginations, I preferred to walk outside, around the assembly hall… besides, it was always cooler outside. (If you don’t agree with me, argue with your phone).

Obodai tagged along. We’d grown close, after all, I owed him my life. Besides, there are two things that bring people closer: food and hardship, and though we didn’t have much food, we’d just survived military rule together. Plus, he was in my class, Science 4. It turned out we had a lot in common.

Entertainment moved pretty quickly. Finally, when it was almost 9pm, the DJ announced that he was playing the last song for the night… that’s when it happened. Normally, you’d think angels stay away from places like the nightclub our assembly hall had been transformed into. I was wrong.

The last thing I remember, Obodai was talking about how Ronaldo would always be in Messi’s shadow (yes, people, this argument has gone on for over a decade), all of a sudden I zoned out. I knew he was talking oo, but I couldn’t hear anything he was saying. He hadn’t seen what I’d just seen.

Ah. No. Impossible. About 10 feet away, sitting on a short wall, sat an angel.

Chale! When did God start allowing girls to be this beautiful? (Y’all thought it was about to get spiritual .😂 Please, beauty is spiritual.)

Herh! The girl was fooooooiiiiiiiine!

I don’t really remember whether Obodai stopped talking, or if I told him anything. I also don’t know where the vim came from, all I know is that before I could say “Who send me?” I was walking toward her… no plan in my head, I was just responding to the sheer awe of God’s artistry, like a bee attracted to a flower.

I had only one prayer… “Father, let her be in first year.” 🙏

Her sunshine (the girls’ prep and entertainment attire) suggested she was my mate. It was pretty easy to identify us: we hadn’t altered our clothes. The seniors called it buoyancy: the amount of extra space in our uniforms made it look like we could float. Mind you, it was an offence to alter your clothes. Figures.

The bee reached his flower… she noticed me.

I opened my mouth… nothing.

Ei!! What just happened?!

I opened my mouth one more time… still, nothing.

In the name of all that is good, what was happening to me?!

She looked confused. Then she giggled.

“Hi?”, she offered.

Yes! Hi! That was the word! Where is English when you need it?

“Hi”, I replied. I’d have a conversation with my tongue later… that little traitor.

I smiled shyly. “I – I’m Kodzo… I’m in Aggrey.”

“Cool, I’m Akua”, she replied.

“So angels have Akan names these days?” Oh shoot! Did I say that out loud?!

“Pardon me”, she inquired.

“Oh, I said you have a nice name”.

Kai, I do yawa. What’s nice about Akua? It just means she was born on a Wednesday.

“What’s nice about Akua?”, she echoed my thoughts.

Ei, this girl… can’t you see I’m suffering to talk to you?

“Ermm, it reminds me of Aqua… and you know, water is life”, I lied.

Water is life? REALLYYYY??? Some girls were going to laugh at me in their dorm tonight. She stifled her laughter and smiled.

Mama Mia! Dimples! 😍

“Oh, I thought maybe it was your mum’s name”, she offered.

“Yeeeeah, that would have been an easier explanation”, I agreed. I had to change the subject fast.

“So which house are you in?”, I said, while digging my hands into my pockets.

“I’m in Baeta. You’re in first year?”

This was the make or break moment.

“Yes”, I replied, “you?”

She smiled and nodded, “Me too.”

Thank you, sweet Jesus.

This time I made sure to think it and not speak it.

It was time for phase 2: ask her what class she’s in.

It was at this critical moment that the DJ chose to make this poor announcement, “Alright, people! It’s been a great night, but we have to close. I’ve been your DJ, DJ Opele. All Aggrey form one boys are waiting behind to pack the sound equipment!”

Ah, this guy spoil my move… and what kind of name is Opele? Mcheeew.

“I guess they need you. Aggrey house, right?”, she nodded in the direction of the assembly hall stage.

“Yeah”, I replied, “Aggrey boys deɛ, abi you know”.

Right on cue, Eben came out of the assembly hall and started looking for Aggrey form one boys idling about. Nobody told me to excuse myself.

“See you around, Akua.”

“See you, Kodzo”, she said while waving… Motown girls liked waving at close range.

I tried to wave back, but my stupid hands were still in my pocket. We laughed it off, and I turned and walked away.

I’d sleep well tonight.

I wasn’t joking when I said I’d sleep well after talking to Akua. Chale… I slept like a baby — which is a bad expression, considering how often babies wake up to cry in the night. I woke up the next morning with a new zest for life. Oh, Akua! 💓

Nobody could dampen my spirit oo, nobody! Not the bell-boys, not the house prefects, not even Smizzle. I did my chores, fetching water with a smile on my face, gallon after gallon. I stayed out of trouble the whole morning.

When we finally got to the Aggrey chapel for Sunday service I looked around. Ah, where was this girl? I went all Vashawn Mitchell…

🎵 I searched all over, couldn’t find nobody

I looked high and low, still couldn’t find nobody… 🎵

Remember I said my spirit couldn’t be dampened? Let’s all laugh together. 😂😂😂

The chaplain too was in the spirit! It was as if God had told him my case to use my situation for his sermon. He said, “Frieeeendsss, our first scripture reading was taken from the book of Proverbs, chapter 13, the verse number 12.

“It says hope deferred… [*dramatic pause*] makes the heart sick. BUT!! [*another dramatic pause*] when the desire comesss… it is a tree of life.”

Chale, Akua had deferred my hope: I didn’t see her in the chapel.

After the service, we went for prep, (yes, in Motown we go for prep on Sundays too), I didn’t learn shélé that day. I opened my Prof Quarm Integrated Science book and just day-dreamed. Oh chale, hard guy like me paa, see what a girl had done to me. My heart was sick ampa.

That afternoon, even my gashit lost its taste. I was suffering from acute deficiency of vitamin A… vitamin Akua😔… sigh.

You’re surprised? I was surprised at myself too… I’d try to think of something else, then I’d remember the dimples… then my heart would melt all over again.

What koraa is attractive about dimples? I really don’t get it. Did you know dimples are actually technically a facial deformity? No lie. God truly must be an artist.

After I’d sulked for hours, Atta-Kay, the Scripture Union (SU) rep, banged the bell to announce that it was “time for SU”. Normally, I’d use the time to wash, but I’ll be honest, I felt like I needed deliverance: this girl had messed with my brain.

Back in ’09, SU was held at 3pm in the assembly hall… Yup! The same one that had been a nightclub less than 24 hours earlier. After every Recs Night, the SU leaders had to go there early to “disinfect” the atmosphere with some hot prayers. I was always amazed by how people could pray till they were sweating. It was nothing short of amazing. In later years, SU was moved to the Aggrey chapel after prep. The air is a little cleaner there.

The opening prayer was a continuation of the “disinfection prayers”, just with more formal prayer topics.

My eyes were still closed when the worship leader took over… her voice was so sweet… the song was so beautiful too: one of those old Hillsong tracks about a Saviour moving mountains.

My heart was so warmed… “This must be what Heaven feels like”, I thought.

She raised another song, “Only You are holy”, by Donnie McClurkin. I lifted my hands, raised my head and opened my eyes to peek at this anointed worship minister. This was the day I finally understood why they always ask us to close our eyes in church.

There she stood, leading worship like the angel she was… Akua. No wonder I felt closer to Heaven.

I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, but one thing was for sure… the worship that I was worshipping had ended. I didn’t even try to fool God. I wish I could tell you what was taught at that SU meeting, but I honestly don’t remember, I was too distracted. I marked out the spot where Akua sat and watched for a full hour to make sure she didn’t leave before we they (I was in my own world) closed.

As soon as we they closed I tactically moved in her direction. I had to make it look like we were meeting by accident again… like fate had something to do with it — pre-fabricated fate.

I went round saa, came from behind and tapped her on the shoulder, “Hey Akua”. She turned around and saw me. Her face lit up — a good sign. “Hey Kwaku!”

Wait, what?! This girl wanted to give me a stroke. Kwaku? Barely 24 hours and you’ve forgotten my name?

The look on my face must have told her that she caused a short-circuit in my brain… probably fried a few neurons.

She laughed playfully, covering her mouth. “I’m kidding”, she laughed, “I know it’s Kodzo, don’t cry”.

I laughed too, “Oh, I knew you were playing. Me paa, cry? Ah! The last time I cried was when I was born oo.”

“Ei, are you sure?”, she played along.

“Oh yeah”, I continued, “I’m not a forgettable character oo.”

“Definitely not”, she replied, “anyone who can link Akua to aqua deserves to be remembered.”

I chuckled. My flopped save had not been entirely useless.

“You must be a science student”, she inferred, “Aqua gives it away.”

“Haha, yeah. I’m in science 4”, I confirmed.

“Oh nice. I’m in Arts 4!”, she replied. You see? Fate. 😅

“Cool. Ei, but your voice is nice oo”, I complimented her, “You took me deep into the spirit”.

I know, I know, I didn’t enter any spirit biaa, but she didn’t have to know, did she? She blushed and thanked me modestly. At least she didn’t deny it like those false humility people — I liked that.

“You’ll have to teach me how to sing like you oo”, I joked.

She smiled. Dimples! 😍 Gets me every time.

“I’ll try”, she answered.

“Tabitha, we have to go”, a lady shouted behind her. She turned and shouted back, “I’m coming, wait for me.”

“Tabitha?”, I asked, rather confused.

“Yeah”, she replied, “That’s my first name.”

“Oh okay, what’s your full name?”, I asked.

It was a risky question, not because her name could be funny, but because my heavy Ewe name is a force to reckon with.

“Tabitha Akua Givson”, she replied.

“Ei, see dadaba name oo!”, I responded.

She laughed it off. “What’s yours”.

The question I knew was coming.

“Brace yourself”, I advised her, “Kodzo Ametewee-Nutakor.”

I’m not too sure why, but she laughed like it was the funniest thing she had heard all day. “Your name is heavy oo”, she gasped, when she finally caught her breath.

I laughed too. “I know paa”, I said.

“‘Biiiiithaaaa! We’re leaving.” her friend announced. Killjoy!

“I really have to go now”, she apologized, “See you around Mr. Nutakor”.

It’s a compound name, I should have corrected her… but I let it go. “See you Tabitha”, I replied.

She smiled. Dimples! 😍 I really should get over dimples.

“I like ‘Akua’ like that. Tabitha is for filling forms”, she said, already walking backwards.

“See you”, I said, while waving. She waved back, turned and ran to join her friends.

I should clarify this: Motown has two compounds, the main compound (the East) where Aggrey House is, and the western compound (the West), separated by a road. Baeta House is on the West. They have their own dining hall and prep times, so you only see your western friends during class hours, entertainment, special programs and club meetings, or at SU.

One thing was certain from that day: I was never going to miss an SU meeting.

Before I continue, it’s about time you met my school father. If you’re new to the concept, a “school father/mother” is a a senior who kind of takes you under their wing. It’s a mutually beneficial relationship. They advise you (both good and bad advice) and protect you from other seniors… (I know, sounds like a prison yard, right?) In return, you run errands, and sometimes, do personal chores for them. School parents and school children also tend to eat from each other’s chopboxes quite often. The best school-father-school-son relationships are built on a solid friendship.

My school father was called Gbewee — no, that was not his real name.

Gbewee is actually of Ewe origin. ‘Gbɛ’ means leaf, and ‘wee’ is the common Ghanaian pronunciation for weed; ganja, indian hemp, marijuana, pot… whatever you affectionately call cannabis. So yes, technically I was raised by weed leaves. The fact that I’ve never smoked is a miracle in itself.

Gbewee had a pet name for me: Kwasea. That boy spoke so much negativity, I always had to “re-bless” my life. If you dare call me that, I will smack the taste out of your mouth. But all jokes aside, Gbewee was a cool guy.

Ei, or is it possible he was so cool because he was always high? 🤔 I guess I’ll never know… I never actually saw him smoke. I hear he works in a bank now. Good for him.

Anyway, that night he called me to the inner chamber, “Kwassseeaaaa!!”.

“Gbewee!”, I replied.

“Come here!”

I entered the inner chamber, went to his corner, and sat on his trunk.

“Today I see say you dey talk plus some nice girl for SU…”, he started.

I cut in, laughing, “Ah, you were at SU?”

A knock descended from an unexpected direction. Ouch.

“Foolish boy, you dey see me demon?”, he retorted. He continued,  “But she nice oo! I see you norr I talk say ‘Yeeeah, ma boy that.’ What’s her name?”

“Tabitha Givson”, I replied. The name ‘Akua’ was for me alone.

“Herh, Givson. I know that name. Ihn poppie be some rich man. Diaby, you norr am?”, he asked another senior in the inner chamber.

“Yeah”, Diaby replied, “Some rich man for Sakumono. Why, Kodzo dey chase ihn daughter? I hear say she get boy oo.”

Ao! My heart! Why are all the nice girls taken? 😩 But I couldn’t let it show on my face.

“Oh we just be paddies”, I spoke up.

They both laughed. “Listen”, Gbewee replied, “there is no such thing as ‘just friends’ with a fine girl. Get up and go to bed.”

You see, he just confused me and sent me to bed. I didn’t really understand what he said, but he said it like he believed it, and that meant something. I’d have to ask him again later… maybe it was weed talking… who knows?

I closed my eyes and slept. I’d probably dream about Akua anyway.

The chaplain’s sermon rang in my head as I drifted off to sleep that night…

…when the desire comesss… it is a tree of life.

Motown has always had an interesting array of teachers… We’ve had teachers who spent invigilation time calculating figures for the lottery; we’ve had teachers who force everyone to call them “Professor”; we’ve had teachers who would use the F-word on you in class… you name it, we’ve had it. But of all the interesting teachers that ever were, Awazzy (meaning unknown, and real name forgotten) was definitely one to look out for. He taught us Social Studies during our first year in Science 4.

Awazzy had bushy hair and a pretty thick beard… a typical pan-African look… except, I can’t say for sure whether he gave a hoot about Africa. All I know for sure is that he loved Economics, his guitar, his wife and his farm; just not in that order.

Obviously, Awazzy would never teach us economics; we were science students. Very few of us ever saw his wife. The few who did said she was pretty, and he always spoke fondly of her: Mrs Awazzy. As for his guitar (and self-composed songs), for a full year he promised to bring the guitar to class and play one of his songs for us — he never did.

However, I do remember finding a video of him online, playing and singing “Babylon system bad, Babylon system wicked“. Sadly, that video is no longer on the internet… I checked.

He also said he’d write a Social Studies past questions book, “Awazzy For WASSCE”… I don’t know if he ever did.

This story, however, is about Awazzy’s farm… his cassava farm.

Out of 40 students, science 4 had just about 10 girls, maybe less… I don’t remember. The mere fact that we were predominantly a male class, however, meant that the class was always, always, always hard to control. I would introduce everyone if I could, but really, how long do you want this story to be? Just flow with the names as they come.

Now Awazzy was a cool guy, so we didn’t like to give him a tough time. but every once in a while we’d get on his nerves. He had this “take-it-easy” air about him and he spoke like… well, to be honest, he spoke like Bob Marley. No, I’m not insinuating anything…I’m telling you how he spoke. So as you read anything he says, read it with a Bob Marley accent in your head.

Anytime we got on Awazzy’s nerves, his go-to startegy was to make everyone stand on their desk. BUT we knew his kryptonite. Awazzy never knew how to respond to “flow” and “fans”. He’d start blushing beneath his beard and discontinue whatever punishment he had given you. So typically, we’d be standing on our desks, and then one person, usually Jona, would start from the back in a low tone, “AWAAAAAAAAAAZZY”, then another voice, most likely Archie, would come from another corner, “AWAAAAAAAAAAAZZY”, then the voices would unite, “AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZY”, and everybody would jump in from there, “AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZYYYYY” until he’d become shy because other teachers would start coming out of their classes to see what was happening. Then he’d go like [insert Bob Marley tone], “Pleeeeease, pleeeeease, you guys are disturbing.”

“AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZYYYYY“, we’d interject.

“Okay, Okay, take your seeeats”.

Funny enough, even while taking our seats we’d still be flowing him. What at all was the matter with us?

Anyway, this strategy worked for weeks, then one day our class prefect, Onukpa–also known as the god of sleep becuase he could sleep through anything–did the unthinkable! He lost Awazzy’s notebook.

I know, I know, big deal right? How much does a notebook cost anyway? Tell that to Awazzy.

The dude got soooooo pissed, I was like, “Ei, chief, why?”, but of course I asked in my head. I’m not an idiot.

Awazzy could not be consoled. Till this day I don’t know why, but the guy had it out for us.

In Awazzy’s class, we prayed before he started teaching — it was his own little tradition. From that day, at the end of the prayer, he’d start the lesson with this line, “Science four… You’re all thieeeeeves.”

Days passed, still no notebook — I bet if he sees me today he’ll ask for his notebook — then one day we got on his nerves again. I can’t remember who exactly caused the commotion, but it’s usually safe to assume it was Climax (yup, we had a lot of weird names). This was Awazzy’s opportunity to get us back for the notebook… I honestly believe we would have been forgiven if he had his precious notebook, but it never came back.

Awazzy declared, “Science 4, you will weeeeed! Where is the class prefect?”

Onukpa was asleep. (See, god of sleep).

Poto-Weezy, the assistant, stood up.

Awazzy addressed her, “This evening, all of you should be at my farm with sharp cutlasses by 4pm. You will check the roll. Do you understand?”

And with that he walked out of the class before we could flow him for him to change his mind.

So that’s how we ended up standing in Awazzy’s cassava farm at 4pm. It was a young farm, most of the cassava shoots still had soft green stems. By “we”, I mean 16 fearos from the class. 24 people legit didn’t fear. Heck, even the class prefects didn’t show up.

Now here’s the most interesting part… even Awazzy himself didn’t show up.

The man forgot that he had punished us. I was there thinking, “Yo! If you’re going to punish me, the least you could do is show up!” Once again, I thought it, I didn’t speak it… hard guy, hard guy, but I stood there for 30 minutes waiting for him to come and punish me. I’m suddenly so disappointed in my high school self.

After what seemed like forever, Obodai suggested, “Chale, let’s go back to the house.”

“Yeah”, I agreed, “This be waste of time. Like by now we set some gashit koraa.”

Out of frustration I swung my cutlass at the stem of one of the cassava plants, severing it right above the roots.

A look of horror crossed Obodai’s face. Ei, what had I just done? I picked up the stem, started digging and stuck it in the ground. It fell right over. Yawa! I dug deeper and stuck it in the ground once more. This time it stood, albeit a little bent over.

Good enough, I thought. I stood up, picked up my cutlass and turned to leave, but what I saw horrified me… here were Science 4 people cutting down the man’s cassava!

“What are you guys doing?!”, I yelled.

One guy, Marvin, replied, “Abi we dey weed?”

“You dey weed?! You dey weed?!!!”, I asked, shocked. Was he joking or he was serious?

“Yeah”, he replied, rather genuinely. He looked at me like I was over-reacting.

It suddenly hit me… this dadaba boy didn’t know what a cassava plant looked like.

“That’s cassava”, I explained. Everyone froze. T

hen Climax broke out laughing, “Marvin do yawa!”

“But you cut some”, I retorted.

“E no be you you start?”, he asked me. Ouch. “Besides, I know say e be cassava, I just figure say we all dey mafia Awazzy sake of he waste wonna time”, he shrugged. Pure evil, that boy.

What happened next is proof that high school is the best place to learn loyalty… we swore ourselves to secrecy and ran out of that farm like we were fleeing fornication.

A lot of us learnt something that day, and hopefully, you have too. I learnt that being a fearo would get me nowhere; I learnt that some of my classmates were pure evil; and I learnt that dadaba people can’t identify cassava.

I think Awazzy also learnt something: that he’s not a hard guy after all (see who’s talking)… he handed us over to the sanctions prefect, Boti — one mean dude — and we got the punishment we deserved. By the way, when Boti punishes a class, no one can escape. We weeded for real that time, from Onukpa to to the least of us.

But in all of this, I guess I was just grateful that Akua didn’t see me weeding.

As a child, I learnt all about letter-writing: formal letters, semi-formal letters, informal letters, block addresses, slanted addresses, stamps… everything. In Ghanaian high schools, every form of modern technology is non-school i.e.banned, so I thought I’d finally get to use all that I had learnt in the 2nd grade, but like most things I learnt early in school, traditional letter writing methods were obsolete by the time I actually needed to write letters. Say hello to Easylink.

Easylink, and sister company, Easyconnect, was a huge deal in high school. It was, and maybe still is, a postal service linking all popular high schools in Ghana. So whereas you would normally have to buy a stamp, walk to a post office and fill out an address like this:

Adwoa Mansah.

Wesley Girls High School,

P.O. Box 61,

Cape Coast

With Easylink, you’d just circle “Wesley Girls” on the envelope, and fill in the recipient’s details:

Adwoa Mansah,

1 Science 1,

Compton House

Easy, right? They don’t call it Easylink for nothing.

Of course, we didn’t care much for writing good English either. For the most part, we wrote like we were texting. No, Gen-Z, not modern QWERTY texting, I mean hard-core SMS texting like the days before smartphones, when you had to text with the number key-pad. Back then, the shorter your shorthand, the cooler you were.

Introductions which used to read like this…

    My dearest, sweetest, fondest, fantastic, extraordinary, paragon of beauty a.k.a Lizzy.

    I hope this letter meets you in a fabulous state of metabolism, if so doxology. My principal aim in writing this letter to you is to gravitate your mind towards a matter of global and universal importance, which has been troubling my soul.

    The matter is so important. Even as I am writing, my adrenalin is 100 per cent on the Richter scale, my temperature is rising, the wind vane of my mind is pointing North, South and East at the same time; the mirror in my eyes has only your divine image. Indeed when I sleep, you are the one in my medulla oblongata, and I dream about you. I went out to sea in my dream, and I saw you: surrounded by H20 and you in your majesty rose from the abdomen of the sea like Yemoja, the avatar of beauty.

… now read like this…

    Hey boo! ‘Sup!

    Drmt ’bout u last nyt.

Of course, you dared not send a shorthand letter to Wesley Girls. Those Gey Hey girls ehnn…

Rumour Legend has it that once upon a time a guy wrote a letter to a Gey Hey girl in shorthand. She took a red pen, corrected all his grammar, and mailed the letter back to him… but not before they made a photocopy and put it on their noticeboards. Savage, chale, savage.

But you get the idea… letters were a big deal.

Every Ghanaian 90’s baby should have heard the rhyme that goes like this:

    There was a man — mango

    Sitting on the sun — santo

    He wrote a leh — letter

    Letter dunafa — fanta

If I have made a mistake in writing out this rhyme, then you know, like I know, that nobody ever tried to write this out for any reason. So please, leave me alone.😒

This story is not really about me, nor does it have anything to do with the man who wrote the “letter dunafa”.

It’s about a guy we called Banana and his experience with Easylink. Actually, he called himself Banana… I never knew why, but we… errmm… “respected” his decision to be identified as a fruit. Who am I to judge? It worked for Apple.

Once upon a time, Banana wrote a letter to a girl in a school far far away. I don’t know her and I don’t remember her name either… I don’t even remember which school exactly, but boy, did he invest into that letter.

Since there wasn’t much fuss about the “weight” of the English in your letter back in 2009, the emphasis was more on the design… and the ‘features’, shout outs from other students, at the back.

So we wrote our letters on colourfully designed writing paper, or else we paid some of the more artistic students to design the name of the recipient on a plain sheet. The really wild people, like Banana in his prime, would buy the already designed writing paper and then get someone to design the recipient’s name on it. Then they would perfume it and draw tiny hearts all over the sheet.

An elaborate display of affection? Nah… the boys just couldn’t write much. 😂😂😂

True disgrace is when you finish writing your letter–remember it’s in shorthand–and there’s half a page of nothing — a text vacuum — staring up at you. You dare not post that to someone’s daughter.

What are you trying to tell her? That she’s not inspiring enough?

After writing your letter came the best part: the features.

Featuring, or giving shout outs, back in high school, was perching on someone’s letter to say hi to the person, or someone else you knew in that person’s house or class. It was also a somewhat weird, yet oddly effective way of making new friends.

What it meant for the writer, however, was that his/her letter got showcased, first, when they went out to solicit for features, and also when the recipient went out to deliver featured messages.

That’s how we all got to hear about the sheer wonder of Banana’s letter. No, I didn’t feature–that’s why I don’t know her name–but we all heard wonders about the designs, and how this girl was one of the prettiest human beings on the face of the planet.

She was definitely not prettier than my Akua though. 😉

At break time that day, as Banana headed out to post his super-letter, an entourage of boys-boys followed him from the form 1 science block to the registry — the office where we sent and received letters.

“Boys-boys” were never quiet. We really brought the energy. “B-A-Nana!!” “Nana Banana!!” “Banaaaaaaana!!!” All the way from the science block to the registry.

When we arrived, Banana motioned for us to be quiet. He pulled out his last secret weapon from his pocket; a Motown wrist-band! He dropped it into the Easylink envelope and sealed his doom, ei, his envelope–let me not get ahead of myself.😅

The crowd went wild! “Banana, you do all!!” “Oseeee Banana!!” “The only B-A-Nana!!!”

As far as we were concerned, this girl’s heart would be putty in his hands.

“But if she no reply aa, yawa oo!”, George said out of nowhere. He was this shifty boy who looked innocent outside, but you did not want to do yawa around him.

Banana didn’t miss a beat in his contemptuous reply. “Fior! If e be you aa, like you no go reply? You figure my mouth die like your own?”

If only he had laughed it off in a kinder way.

You need to know something about boys-boys: boys-boys do not forget. Four weeks was more than enough time to get a reply, especially for a letter of that calibre, and the boys just wouldn’t let him forget.

For the first two weeks or so he was fine, until George started releasing little jabs.

“Yo! Aki-Ola, you publish any new books?”

“Chale, Banana, I go buy wristband oo, your girl send you some?”

“Banana, that your girl she dey school for Mars or what?”

By the end of the 4th week, Banana had been to the registry about 15 times to check if he had any letter… Then one day… If I were preaching, I’d say, “Turn to your neighbour and say: One Day!!”…

One day, during break time, Banana burst into Science 4, not because my class was a hub for socialization, but just because George was in my class.

“Where my haters at? Where them dey? That George boy, where he dey?” In his hand he brandished a white envelope.

Every instinct in me screamed, “Something’s wrong! Stop him!” But hey, nobody ever accused me of being a hero.

Banana walked straight to George’s desk. George looked a bit pressured. Boys-boys rushed to the desk like flies to… 💩 hey… we surrounded the desk, okay?

Banana held out the envelope. It looked thick, which was usually a good sign, maybe it contained a school magazine. But why did it seem so off?

“Gbele am”–open it—the boys cheered.

As he began to open the envelope it suddenly hit me! The stamp! Easylink didn’t use stamps!

It was too late now.

Honestly, this must be the moment where I finally understood that patience is a virtue.

He ripped the envelope open… he pulled out the letter… he read the first line… he froze.

George grabbed the letter, read the first line and dropped to the floor in a fit of laughter.

I picked the letter quickly and read the first line, typed and printed, out loud, “The Presbyterian Church of Ghana, Teshie Congregation…”

I couldn’t! I just couldn’t continue!! Half of the boys and were on the floor laughing. The thickness of the envelope was because of the attached Presbyterian Young People’s Guild newsletter.

Chale, even Banana had to laugh at his own silliness.

So whatever happened to the letter? Did it make it to the school? Did Easylink lose it? Or maybe George intercepted it somehow?

The answer is quite simple, really: I don’t know.

On this particular morning, I woke up with some weird joy… today was going to be a good day, I could feel it. It was my birthday!!! 15 never looked better, chale.

As a form one boy in Motown, there were two really simple tricks to staying happy on your birthday:

    1. Determine beforehand to remain happy — in form one, happiness is a conscious decision, not a fleeting emotion.

    2. Tell NO ONE that it is your birthday.

The first rule was necessary simply because there were always people, teachers or students, ready to trample on your joy for free. But that’s everyday form one life… nothing new there.

The second rule was actually the more important one — and for good reason.

Nowl, my dear Ghanaians, “ponding” is not even a real word, at least, not in the way that we use it.

When a Ghanaian says they’ll pond you, it means they’ll pour water on you while you’re still fully dressed. It’s a birthday tradition popular with Ghanaian millennials.

However, when a Ghanaian high school or university student says he’ll pond you… run. They mean you no good. In addition to water, there will be powder, sand, strokes of a belt, all manner of creative methods of inflicting pain and humiliation.

I’ve legit seen someone take a gate to the face by accident during a ponding… yeah, a metal gate, the one you have to open to let the car into the house. (Don’t worry, he survived).

Personally, I was hunted like a deer and ponded me in the middle of the street once.

You get the idea… if the boys hear it’s your birthday, your day is going to end differently.

So, smart boy that I am, I woke up, did my chores, and began my day quietly. I can’t coman kee maself.

The only person who knew was Obodai, and if he didn’t rat me out for the bolus incident, my birthday secret was safe with him.

By break time I’d been having a great day. I’d solved a killer math question on the board earlier, and managed to stay awake during Chemistry class. When your Chemistry teacher is nicknamed “Coma” for constantly putting people to sleep in his lessons, you know you’ve done well to stay up through an hour of his teaching.

So when the school bell rang signalling break time, I congratulated myself on making it through the first half or so of the day peacefully. It was time to reward myself with a birthday treat: “Vitale” —  yoghurt made by the home economics department — with samosas and sausage rolls. I gathered my coins from my bag, lifted my head and almost had a heart attack.

Akua! She was standing, right in front of my desk, with a mischievous smile on her face.

When did she sneak into the classroom? What was she doing here? Why did she look so crafty? And how was it possible for one human being to be so fine?? 😩😩😩

“Hi, Kodzo!” She greeted so animatedly.

“Hey”, I replied with my best smile. “What brings you here?”

“Oh, nothing, I’ve just missed you.”

“Ehnn?”, I thought. “Ehnn?”, my mouth echoed. We’d just been on “Hi” and “Bye” terms for weeks now.

“Oh, I said I’ve missed you la, na me deɛ gyae w’asɛm. Let’s go get a snack”.

I did a mental check of how much food my coins could buy. It couldn’t buy much.

“I’m going to buy vitale oo”, I said, “Abi you deɛ you eat pack chow, or?”

“Silly boy.” She laughed, displaying her dimples, oh those dimples. 😍 “Let’s go and buy the vitale. That pack chow can’t satisfy me anyway.”

Seriously, that food couldn’t satisfy anyone, but that’s a story for another day.

As we walked to the vitale stand a voice in my head kept scolding me. “Foolish boy! On your birthday you’re taking a girl to snack with 2 cedis and 20 pesewas. Are you serious in life?”

You should convert GHS2.20 to dollars with Google if you don’t speak cedis. You’ll laugh!

“Get behind me Satan”, I whispered under my breath.

Akua looked at me sideways with a puzzled look. “Pardon me?”

“Oh nothing”, I replied.

Another second of thought. “I was rebuking the devil.”

She thought it was a joke. “Eishh, man of God, he was telling you I’m a temptation eh?”

“Oh how?” I replied. “Akua paa? He was laughing at me that I’m taking a girl to snack with just coins.”

The girl almost fell down laughing. “Ah! But — but I’m the one who asked us to go to snack together.” She was gasping to catch her breath now, and her eyes glistened with tears from laughter.

“I’m paying.” She said it so matter-of-factly.

Such a sweet girl. But abi you know dada, hard guy like me, I had to refuse the offer the first time.

“Oh I’ll pay and we’ll share.”

She looked at me, with mock seriousness. “Kodzo, I’m not playing with my food… and I won’t offer again”. She added that last part with a sly smile that said “checkmate”.

I surrendered. “It’s okay, dadaba girl. I’ll let you pay today, but I’ll get you one of these days.”

With a belly full of vitale, sausage rolls and samosas; and a heart full of the joy that comes from sharing a meal with an angel, I walked back to the form 1 block with Akua.

I felt like I’d made it in life. Look at me walking with the embodiment of prettiness. This was the best birthday ever! And she didn’t even know.

Maybe it was fate after all. We’d had fun at the vitale stand. I’d told her about the bolus launching, and sworn her to secrecy. The story tickled her so badly she laughed till yoghurt came out her nose — fountain of sweetness that she was. 😂

As soon as we got to the front of my class that annoying person in charge tolled the school bell. Break was over. Those darn bellboys!

She smiled at me. “I have to go. We should do this more often.”

“I agree. Thanks for the snack.”

She took two steps toward the staircase. Arts 4, was upstairs.

Suddenly, as if on second thought, she came back, wrapped me in a hug and whispered in my ear, “Happy birthday Kodzo”.

I don’t know how to put this less disgracefully: I blacked out.

No, I didn’t faint or fall… but I lost conscious control of my senses for like 20 seconds. When I came to myself she was gone.

But — but how did she know?! Had anybody seen what just happened? Did anyone hear that it was my birthday?

I entered the classroom, and everyone was quiet, looking at me weird.

Climax started taking off his belt. “E be your birthday?”

“Foolish boy. E be you born me?” I retorted. My bluff game was strong oo.

“You dey lie, e be your birthday. That be why the chick hug you make you conf.”

He tried to hold his ground, albeit a little less sure of himself now. If only he knew how accurate he was.

I put on my most serious face. “If you take this belt touch me, I go beat you like some kiddie for here.”

I haven’t mentioned that Climax is short, have I? Well, he is, and I played the height card to perfection, walking closer and staring him down till he had to look all the way up to see my face. Nobody told him to back down.

The next teacher entered the room right then. Kodzo 1 : 0 Climax.

I made it to prep without a scratch. It really had been a good day.

Snack break with Akua alone was the bomb, and the rest of the day had just been really cool. I’d called home and heard from the fam, eaten some heavy gashit, and avoided getting a birthday beatdown.

When I got to prep, I sat behind my desk and started studying. Just kidding, I put my head down to sleep. Chale, I was tired.

Just before I could drift off to sleep, I noticed a blue sheet sticking out of the corner of my desk’s compartment. I didn’t remember putting anything there.

I pulled out the sheet only to realise it was a blue hand-made birthday card. I quickly looked around to make sure nobody had seen it.

I was safe.

The card had “Kodzo” boldly written on the outside. I slid it into my Aki-Ola Core Math book — stealth mode, chale.

    Hey Kodzo,

    I didn’t hear about the birthday early enuf, else I woulda gotten u a better card. (Obodai seemed kinda hesitant 2 tell me) Apparently, I would be putting ur life in mortal danger if I leaked the info. But abi u deɛ, smart guy, who can pond u?

    Anyway, this is just 2 let u know that u r a gr8 guy and I’m glad to have met u. HAPI B’DAY!!! And have a blast!

    XOXO

    Akua Aqua – Water is Life

    PS.

    I was serious when I said we should do the vitale and sausage roll thing more often.

Forget the plenty shorthand — have you ever seen someone just sitting at prep, smiling like an idiot? You should have seen me and my 50 gigawatt smile. I could have done a straight two-hour photoshoot without losing that smile. I so owed Obodai one. What a pal!

Plus this girl paa? Water is life. 😂😂😂 She remembered!

Needless to say, I didn’t sleep at prep anymore. This girl’s card was giving me life. I read it and re-read it saaaaa. When the bell was tolled for the end of prep I picked up my bag, tucked my Core Math book into my armpit and made my way towards the door. I was going to memorize the card that night.

“Kodzo, you dropped something”. It was Eyram, one Kingsley girl. I looked on the floor behind me and saw the card.

“Thanks.”

“Herh! Birthday card!!” Climax had seen the card!😲😱

Everything slowed down in the next few moments. It was like The Matrix.

Climax whipped out his belt. I grabbed the card. Boys-boys blocked the doorway. Climax flung the belt. His short arm missed me as I side-stepped his reach.

I don’t know how I did this next thing, maybe I’ll make a good rugby player, but next thing I knew I had charged through the human wall at the door and [slow-mo ends here] I was running into the night with like 15 boys chasing me… one for each year of my new age.

I’d like to say I outran them. I really would. But who am I kidding?

They caught me and taught me a lesson in opportunity cost: Was it worth it that I got the worst ponding in form 1 history because my secret was given away by a card from the most awesome girl on campus?

You bet it was worth it. And I’d go through it again and again if I had to… because Water is Life.

“Pssst!”

I didn’t mind him.

“Psssssssst!”

Could this guy not take a hint?

“Psssssssssssssssst! Herh, Kodzo, I know say you hear me.”

There is a phenomenon in Motown known as ‘Atico’. Herh, Atico, that thing ehnn. Hmmmm.

In Motown, every term, there are two major tests, the “Monthly Tests”, followed by an end-of-term exam. These monthly tests contributed to 30% of your grades for the term, but that’s not why we cared. The real motive for doing well in the monthly tests was to avoid the Atico list.

Every term, right before the midterm break, a list would be posted on the notice board at the school’s administration block — the Atico List. If your name appeared on this list, if you “dropped Atico“, you were not going home for the midterm break. You would stay in school and learn for like three to five days while everyone else went home… sad, chale, just sad.

So how do you drop Atico? What crime did you have to commit to earn a spot on this list of men and women who wouldn’t get to see their parents over the weekend?

It’s actually easier than you think. All you had to do was get less than 50%, the “red-circle” mark, in any two subjects in one term, and congratulations, no midterm break for you the next term.

Sucks, huh? Guess what, the red-circle mark was moved up to 55% in my third year. After that change, there was a term where almost half of the whole school did not go home for the midterm break.

Those were weird times — you couldn’t look at people’s faces when your parents came to pick you up.

Anyway, I hope you realize how this made the monthly tests important. Each test was a chance to redeem a chunk of the 50% that would determine whether or not you would have a midterm break the next term. Acing the tests meant you had less ground to cover in the end-of-term exams. Flunking meant you had to squeeze every last mark out of your papers in the end-of-term.

I wasn’t a bad student in school, I won’t even lie. My dad had faith that I could become a Brilla boy, one of the elite students who represented their schools in the National Science and Math Quiz televised every year.

Honestly, I wasn’t some ultra-nerd, but chale, I was doing well—me too God has blessed me—and as the monthly test approached, people noticed.

You learn a lot in high school. Maybe you don’t learn all the math and science your parents hoped you would, but you will definitely learn a lot.

Heck, even if you somehow manage to learn nothing, it will be a whole lot of nothing.

In Motown, some people learned what is known as “exams formation”. 4-4-2 and 4-3-2-1 took on different meanings during exam and test periods, except that ‘Messi’ is some unfortunate nerd whose work will be copied by Thiago and Fabregas, who will then propagate the answers backward to Adriano, Busquets, and Alves, and so on. You get the idea. The term “Academic Integrity Violation” was unknown to these high school miscreants.

Sometimes the nerd is in on the formation, other times he is an innocent pawn who finds himself at the center of a system designed to outwit the invigilators.

And that’s what happened to me: I was the nerd at the forefront of a formation in the worst paper of our first ever monthly test, physical education.

Wait, you thought I’d say mathematics? You obviously have not taken Mr. Bruce’s P.E. test before; it is more intensive than medical school anatomy exams.

So there I was, trying to remember whether the human hand had metatarsals or metacarpals, and how many bones make up an adult’s spine, and this guy, let’s call him Eli, was there disturbing me, “Pssssst, pssssst!”

I know what some of you are thinking: tell him the answer already.

Relax, it’s my story, not yours. Okay, now that you are all caught up, let’s pick up where we left off:

I didn’t mind him.

“Psssssssst!”

Could this guy not take a hint?

“Psssssssssssssssst! Herh, Kodzo, I know say you hear me. What be number five?”

Sorry to disappoint you. I did not know the answer to number five.

Also, if I knew the answer to number five, I would not have told him. There were forty questions on that paper; no way I was going to encourage him to see me as the source of his next thirty-five answers.

Again, even if I wanted to tell him the answer, I still wouldn’t have.

I have this chronic condition called a working conscience.

I know, it’s a weird condition to have in the 21st century, but I’m one of those people who contracted it from our parents and friends through no fault of ours. We can even go a step further and blame Jiminy Cricket from Disney’s Pinocchio animation.

    Always let your conscience be your guide - Jiminy Cricket

And so I played deaf, but I promise, this guy was persistent.

Where was the invigilator anyway?

“Psssssssssssssssssst! Oh, I beg, just number five”, Eli’s voice came again.

I turned around with every intention of telling him, “Dude, I don’t know the answer”. I managed to get out the word “Dude”.

Guess who decided to show up then.

If your guess was the invigilator, I honestly wish you were right.

“Are you tchalking during a tchesht?!”

It was J-Poons, the senior housemaster himself! The one who talked funny.

“Oh sir, please, no… I, I, I was… It was… “, I stuttered.

“Foolish boy, you have been caughtch red-handed and you’re going tcho lie?! Justch form one, and you’re already lying and practchishing exsham malpractchish?!”

The class was deathly quiet.

I couldn’t even laugh at J-Poon’s weird pronunciations. I wanted to cry — forget ‘hard guy’. $#** just got real.

“Sir, he was picking my eraser for me”, Eli stepped in, cool as an ice cube. He must have had a lot of practice with lying.

“Oh, is that all”, J-Poons replied. Then turning to me he asked, “Ɛna wo nso w’anka hwee?”–And you couldn’t say anything? Just like that, he walked away and it was over.

I didn’t know whether to thank Eli or insult him. What do you do to someone who gets you in trouble and then saves you? I was still contemplating this when his words broke my train of thought, “So the number five, wossop?”

I’m not proud of the insults I rained on him in response. I might have gone as far as to involve his parents. There’s no way I’m repeating those words here.

I turned back to my paper, and the invigilator walked in right then.

“Fifteen minutes more!”

“Your head like ‘fifteen minutes'”, I thought to myself, then I wrote down “metatarsals” as the. answer to number five.

I was wrong.

It turns out the human hand has metacarpals, not metatarsals. Go figure.

Gari is the eighth wonder of the world… the sustainer of high school life… voluminous processed cassava “flakes” that can dubiously trick any rumbling tummy into believing that life is not so bad after all.

Mine was finished. Ladies and gentlemen, there was a crisis on my hands.

Unless he’s a dadaba, gari is the last line of defence between a form one boy and starvation. I cannot speak for the girls, although (this sounds better in pidgin) I hear say dem dey chop gari pass.

In the boarding house, second only to water, gari is life.

Gari has saved more lives than the Avengers. Heck, in a parallel universe where the Avengers are chopbox items, gari would be Thor! Wait, no, gari would be Thanos! Yes, gari would make a good Thanos.

thanos snap

You get the point. Gari is awesome. So when I opened my chopbox one Monday morning and realized that the gari was finished.

Don’t laugh at me yet, my enemies, for Visiting Day was coming. Visiting in Motown is on the first Sunday of every month — yes, you get to see your family once a month — and the next one was a week away, steadily approaching at a rate of 24 hours per day. My parents would bring more gari.

Who was I kidding? I was finished.

My mind began to do calculations that would put IBM Watson to shame. I had 15 cedis on me. Ei, was I sure?

I whipped out my wallet to check. It came out too fast.

According to Newton’s second law, Force = Mass x Acceleration, meaning that my ability to pull out my wallet at such an accelerated speed without much force was an indication of a low mass, hence low weight, hence low cash.

I wasn’t kidding about those calculations.

I looked into the wallet for the verdict.

Five Cedis!!! Five Cedis!!! What was I supposed to do with five Cedis?! Was I being punked? There had to be an explanation!

Somebody must have broken into my trunk and removed some of my money. How?! Who?! Why? Wh- …Akua.

The explanation hit me like a truck moving at top speed on a freeway. I tried to deny it, but I couldn’t.

What was I thinking? I was not. There was no way I could have been thinking straight:

It was on Wednesday, I was walking with my boy, Obodai, talking about a really important topic, “When will skinny jeans go out of fashion?”, you know, important stuff.

We got to the snack square and moved past the overly priced “pack-chow” towards the stuff we could afford, samosas.

We were almost at the samosa stand when I heard my name pronounced ever so sweetly, “Kodzoooooo”. See the way the “oooo” trailed on? My heart lit up, triggering a smile.

Obodai just shook his head and walked off. We both knew I was about to ditch him anyway.

I turned around, and there she stood with a big smile, Akua.

Dimples!! 😍 Gets me every time.

I walked over, oblivious to the dumb decision I was about to make.

“Hey Akua.”

“Hi Kodzo, I’ve missed you oo. You don’t look for me….”

5 minutes later...

I had bought two “pack-chows”, four sausage rolls and two bottles of Coca-Cola.

Please don’t insult me, I can explain.

Ditching Obodai meant I was ditching the samosas, but man had to eat, so I adjusted my budget.

Akua was going to buy pack-chow, so I was also buying pack-chow. That makes sense, right? It does. Right? 😥

I had a weird reaction to this girl, especially since she was the first nice girl to give me any attention. Something in my brain betrayed me. I felt a need to match anything she bought: purchase-for-purchase.

She picked one pack-chow, I picked one. She picked a coke, I picked one. She asked for two sausage rolls, I asked for two.

This is where it gets interesting, she reached into her pocket, and the smile on her face vanished. I’d been making her laugh, so seeing that smile I’d worked so hard to brighten vanish was like watching an eclipse — my world went dark.

“What’s wrong?” I asked.

She stammered. “My- My purse. I- I think I left it”

This is where I should have used my head. This is where I should have said, “We can share mine”, and scored points for being kind. But no, your boy saw an opportunity to attain legendary status.

“Oh, I’ll pay for you.”

I’d like to say I don’t know who spoke those words, but I can’t lie, they came out of my own mouth.

I don’t remember giving any consent to my mouth, but somehow I had offered to pay.

She declined. “Oh no, you don’t have to. I can run to my class and get my purse.”

This was my last chance to get out. This was basically that moment in “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire” where you have to lock in an answer.

“I insist. It’s too far back to the classrooms.”

Big words from a small wallet. Come to think of it, that was actually a reasonable proposal. It’s what I said next that convinced me that my brain had been hacked. “…And don’t bother paying me back. I gotchu.”

I hated myself right then.

I ‘got’ who? I don’t even ‘got’ myself.

But these thoughts fled as soon as her smile returned. The eclipse was over.

“Awww, you’re so sweet”, she cooed, as I took out the money.

I know, pitiful, right?

So that’s how we got here, staring into the abyss that was the depths of an empty chopbox.

I stepped out of the chopbox room and walked to the pay-phone. I didn’t even lock the box, there was nothing to steal.

I inserted my card and punched in my mom’s phone number. The dialling tone dragged on forever, and then she finally picked.

“Ma, me gari asa”–Mom, my gari is finished.

Is that any way to greet your mother?

It was going to be a long week, chale.

Studying is not jollof rice — especially when you don’t like what you’re studying.

Have you ever heard the saying, “Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life”? I figured out the academic version:

    Learn what you love, and you’ll never cram a day in your life.

Unfortunately, I figured this out late in life. Chemistry was hell!!! Oh how I hated that course. 😩

I’d like you to meet my first-year chemistry teacher. We called him “Coma”, because he always put us to sleep — true story. Maybe “Chloroform” would have been a more appropriate name for him, but we didn’t know enough chemistry to get the joke.

Our seniors said Coma was a nice man, but I never saw him smile. Ever. For an entire year, I cannot remember seeing him express joy or happiness of any sort. As far as I was concerned, he was the friggin’ Grinch.

Obviously, Coma’s grinchy disposition was not helping my lack of love for chemistry.

I was not pumped up about the periodic table, or Avogadro’s constant, and I certainly didn’t gie a hoot about the difference between molarity and molality. So imagine my mood when i found out that chemistry was the first exam I had on Monday.

I was in a mess.

Prep time during revision week is very different from regular prep time; there is always this thick, almost tangible air of urgency.

The problem with this new atmosphere it that it seems to inhibit brain functionality. When that pressure sets in, your brain begins to act like a car refusing to start.

The Friday before the paper, I got to prep, opened my text book, and saw all these scary equations jump out at me like some hideous jack-in-a-box.

My thoughts were all mangled; my eyes read the same lines again and again; my eye-lids grew heavy; I woke up- wait, what?! I fell asleep? This was going to be harder than I thought.

A quick glance at my watch told me that it was eight o’clock: one hour to go.

I stood up and moved to the back of the class with my text book… if I couldn’t sit and study I would stand and study.

That day, I learnt that you can stand and sleep. The chemistry was refusing to enter my head.

After I almost fell down sleep-standing, I went back to my desk and began to negotiate with my brain. “Chale, we for learn this thing oo, Atico is real”.

I swear, my brain sang back, “🎵Today I don’t feel like doing aaaaaanything…🎵”

I have not listened to Bruno Mars ever since.

For the next thirty minutes I was begging my brain, "Do stuff 😭."

At the end of prep, the score was Kodzo 0 : 1 Brain. You would think a man’s brain would be on his side.

I did my best for the rest of the week. Out of the four chapters I had to cover I managed to study a whole one and half. At least, I knew that there were 6.02214086 × 1023 atoms in every mole of a substance. I learnt the value in standard form to eight decimal places for good measure. Talk about vanity metrics.

Needless to say, Monday morning rushed at me faster than I could say “Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane“. If ever I hated the sound of the early morning rising bell, it was that Monday morning.

“Bro!”

I looked up. It was Obodai.

“Hey”, I replied, in a rather dreary voice. “Why all the excitement this morning?”

“Chemistry. Adey come kill the paper!”

I was shocked. “You dey barb the chem? You can balance acid-base reaction equations?!”

Here I was thinking we were all in the same boat. Did Obodai knew something I didn’t?

“Oh simple kraa, I thought you got this in class.”

Yup. He knew something I didn’t.

“DUDE!!! I WAS ASLEEP!!!”, I bellowed. “And the textbook wasn’t helping”, I continued, almost ready to cry.

“Prof Quarm?”, he asked.

“Yeah”, I replied.

“Umm, you should throw that book away.” He pulled out an Elective Chemistry textbook from his bag.

Over the next 20 minutes Obodai transformed me into a full-fledged acid-base equation balancer. I could balance acid-base equations for Ghana — I was on a roll.

He flipped to the next page and my heart sunk.

“What do they mean ‘balance the equation between HCL and aluminium’? Aluminium is a metal, not a base.”

“Yeah”, Obodai began to explain, “this is a little diff-”

“Ooooobooooodaaaaaaiiiiiii!!!!”. It was Eben, the house prefect

“Oh shoot! I forgot to iron Eben’s shirt!” And just like that he took off.

I was left trying to make sense of "HCl + Al" like my life depended on it.

Without any shame, I declined to shower that morning. I spent the time trying to understand the equation, really, I tried. It wasn’t working. Throughout breakfast that morning my head was buried in the pages of the book. I didn’t even touch my bread.

After what seemed like forever, and just five minutes before I entered the classroom, I did the unthinkable, I memorized all thirteen remaining equations in the chapter. This is cramming on a level known to Ghanaians as ‘Babadie‘.

I can’t say I was confident when I finally sat down to take the paper. All I could do was pray. My fate was in the hands of Coma, and I felt I needed to move it into Divine hands.

“It’s eight o’clock, turn your sheets over and start work”, the invigilator announced.

Friends, God answers prayer. I turned the sheet over, and smiling up at me was the first question: Write a balanced equation for a reaction between Aluminium and Hydrochloric Acid.

True happiness is when you practice babadie and six out of the thirteen equations you chewed show up in the exam. I poured the answers on the paper before they could leak out of my eyes, ears and nostrils — my brain had already proven that it did not want to be trusted.

At the end of the day, the score was Kodzo 6 : 1 Brain, and Babadie was the man of the match.

Oh, I made that paper cry.

Eventually, Coma was changed as our chemistry teacher, and Mr. Kpodzro took over for Science 4 from our second year till our final year.

Mr. K was a straight up awesome teacher. I never would love chemistry, but at least I could love my teacher enough to fool myself into studying it.

    Learn what you love (or at least, learn from those you love), and you’ll never cram a day in your life.


“… and so I officially declare the first term of the 2009/2010 academic year duly closed!”

The declaration of the assistant headmistress was met with shouts of unmistakeable joy. Our first term in Motown had not been easy, especially the last few days, what the seniors called Akpakus week.

The last few days of every term were exciting, to say the least. There was always a sense of ‘confused joy’. Joy because you could sense that vacation was just around the corner, but also confusion because standing between you and your promised land was a Red Sea of examinations. You could find the boys making plans for vacation chilling one minute, and the next minute they would be discussing the boiling point of ethanol.

No matter how excited we were about going home, we knew we had to deal with the exams first. Atico was also lurking around the corner.

Fortunately for me, after my bout with chemistry, the rest of the papers had behaved themselves. In fact, I was on my way to making straight A’s that term. I was having the academic time of my life.

Not everyone had the same story. Truth be told, a lot of students really got frustrated during the exam period. To alleviate their frustrations, it was common during the last week of school — Akpakus Week — to hear of all manner of pranks being played.

These pranks ranged from mild to serious, and the culmination was on the last night of school, Akpakus Night — after everyone had written their papers and was packing to leave school the next morning. But let me not get ahead of myself.

Poor Alphie was a Livingstone (Livi) House boy in Science 4 whose story is recorded in the Akpakus hall of fame.

Once upon a siesta, during Akpakus week, Alphie woke up suddenly because he felt a strange sensation on his face. It turned out to be powder.

Talcum powder on the face was quite normal during Akpakus. He dusted off the powder and walked to the bathroom to wash his face. When he got back to his dorm, Edem, another science 4 Livi boy, was looking at him funny.

“What e do your face?” Edem inquired. “Oh, somebro pour powder put my top as I dey bed”, Alphie replied, “Why, I no clean am better?”.

Edem was not convinced. “Nah, guy, what e do your face?”

Alphie still didn’t get it, so Edem pulled out a mirror for him to see.

Alphie screamed like a little girl, waking the whole dorm.

Turns out that the talcum powder was not talcum powder, it was a type of shaving powder that made your hair fall off. So when he washed off the powder, along came his right eyebrow.

Yep. I’d scream too.

If it was any consolation, Alphie was not the only Livi boy to lose facial hair that day. Prosper, a Science 3 boy, lost both eyebrows that day. It was a sad day for eyebrows, but darn it they looked hilarious.

The funny thing is, one eyebrow looked weirder than no eyebrows at all, so Alphie looked a lot funnier than Prosper.

It wasn’t hard to find the culprit. It was a senior they called Zuma — it’s kinda hard to pull off a hall of fame prank and shut up about it. His efforts earned him deboardinization, of course, but for what it’s worth, he seemed to enjoy becoming a day-student.

So, like everyone else, I got to prep, took one look at Alphie’s face and burst into a fit of laughter.

In all of this, there was a lesson to be learnt: during Akpakus, you better sleep with one eye open.

(I actually saw someone do this once. It’s real creepy.)

There was a simple golden rule during Akpakus: Everything is legal, just DON’T GET CAUGHT. The implications were serious: everyone was fair game.

The story is told of one boy in Guggisberg house who woke up to find himself on his bed in the bathroom surrounded by twelve hooded men holding candles and chanting. The dude almost had a heart attack! He quoted every scripture he knew, and threw in “No woman no cry” for good measure. Imagine his surprise when they turned on the lights and he realised it was his dorm mates pranking him.

For those who didn’t have time for such sophisticated pranks, they worked with four main tools: water, powder, toothpaste and belts.

I’ve already explained how powder was used to dust people in their sleep; a slightly more wicked variation was the use of toothpaste to line the eyebrows. This happened to one Guggisberg boy called Ekome. Ekome woke up one morning and innocently rubbed his face with his palm, only to temporarily blind himself with minty Pepsodent toothpaste expertly laid on his eyebrows. Pepsodent in your eyes is no way to start your morning, especially when your dorm is upstairs and the taps are downstairs.

In Aggrey House, Umar, the sanctions monitor, was baptized in bed by a group of juniors. Of course, they were not dumb enough to do it directly; they placed a gallon of water on the empty bed planks above him while he slept, and then they went outside, passed a stick through the window, and tipped the gallon of water on top of him.

How I wish I could have done the same thing to the house prefect, but chale, like I keep saying, I was foolish, not an idiot.

The real go-getters were the belt wielders. These guys had personal vendettas to settle.

Me, I just used to tie people’s legs to their beds during Akpakus, nothing serious oo. But the guys who went about lashing people in their sleep… look at their nicknames: Obstinate, Immortal, Rokoto, Salageezy. I was not interested in their game. But to be safe, I began to go to bed with a belt in my hand.

One eye open chale, one eye open.

The bottom line is, Akpakus week was not safe. So when the end of the term was declared I felt I had achieved something. I could actually beat my chest and be proud. I’d survived one term in Motown! I’d survived an entire Akpakus week with both eyebrows! Now only one thing stood between me and my vacation: Akpakus Night.

Akpakus night was a simple game of “you snooze, you lose”. We did everything to stay awake, even playing football as late as 1 AM, but you can’t cheat Nature. There was actually an Aggrey boy called Nature, and you couldn’t cheat him either.

At 4:00 AM, so close to sunrise, and victory, my eyelids gave up on me and closed.

I woke up with a start at 5 AM and instinctively my hand moved to wipe my face.

Wait! I remembered Ekome. I touched my eyebrows, and just as I suspected, Pepsodent.

“Haha”, I laughed, “disaster avoided”.

I smiled and stood up, only to fall flat on my face. My leg had been tied to the bed. Karma really is a “beach”.

But at least I got to keep my eyebrows.

There was an upside a few hours later, while heading to the dining hall for our parting breakfast.

“Kodzooooooo!” That sing-song voice that made my heart tingle.

“Akuaaaaaaaa!”, I sang right back, as I turned around to face the source of the voice. “You were allowed to cross over?”

“Yes oo”, she giggled, “Can anybody stop me?” Actually, everyone could cross over from the east to the west on vacation day. There were no functioning rules at this time.

Akua had a funny look in her eyes. “You forgot something.”

Ah? Me? Forgot something? I couldn’t think of anything, and the confusion showed on my face.

“My number, silly!”, she laughed, holding out a folded piece of paper.

I froze.

You see, I had a little secret. I’d never taken a gir’l’s number before.

There’s a perfectly good explanation: I did not own a phone. I simply did not know what to do with a girl’s number.

How was I supposed to call her? Was I even supposed t call her that night or wait till she missed me? Whose phone would I use?

“Wh-Wh-What network?” I know, lame right?

“MTN”, she responded with a quizzical look, “Why? What network do you use?”

“Oh, you’ll see”, I replied. I quickly took the piece of paper before she changed her mind.

“Kodzo, you’re weird”, she said playfully, “you’re lucky you’re cute”.

Herh, me tri mu yɛɛ me dɛ at once. Kyerɛ sɛ me yɛ cute boy. (Oh, yeah, not everyone speak Twi: I became light-headed because she called me cute.)

“I have to get going”, she said, walking away backwards and waving at close range. Typical Motown girl. Then as if on second thought, she came back and gave me a hug. This time I didn’t black out — I was a big boy.

She smelled like flowers 😉.

“Call me oo”, she prodded as she let me go.

“I will”, I responded. I didn’t know how, but I would find a way…Closing Assembly

“… and so I officially declare the first term of the 2009/2010 academic year duly closed!”

The declaration of the assistant headmistress was met with shouts of unmistakeable joy. Our first term in Motown had not been easy, especially the last few days, what the seniors called Akpakus week.

Akpakus week

Not everyone had the same story. Truth be told, a lot of students really got frustrated during the exam period. To alleviate their frustrations, it was common during the last week of school — Akpakus Week — to hear of all manner of pranks being played.

These pranks ranged from mild to serious, and the culmination was on the last night of school, Akpakus Night — after everyone had written their papers and was packing to leave school the next morning. But let me not get ahead of myself.

Mono-brow Alphie and the rest

Poor Alphie was a Livingstone (Livi) House boy in Science 4 whose story is recorded in the Akpakus hall of fame.

Once upon a siesta, during Akpakus week, Alphie woke up suddenly because he felt a strange sensation on his face. It turned out to be powder.

Talcum powder on the face was quite normal during Akpakus. He dusted off the powder and walked to the bathroom to wash his face. When he got back to his dorm, Edem, another science 4 Livi boy, was looking at him funny.

“What e do your face?” Edem inquired. “Oh, somebro pour powder put my top as I dey bed”, Alphie replied, “Why, I no clean am better?”.

Edem was not convinced. “Nah, guy, what e do your face?”

Alphie still didn’t get it, so Edem pulled out a mirror for him to see.

Alphie screamed like a little girl, waking the whole dorm.

Turns out that the talcum powder was not talcum powder, it was a type of shaving powder that made your hair fall off. So when he washed off the powder, along came his right eyebrow.

Yep. I’d scream too.

If it was any consolation, Alphie was not the only Livi boy to lose facial hair that day. Prosper, a Science 3 boy, lost both eyebrows that day. It was a sad day for eyebrows, but darn it they looked hilarious.

The funny thing is, one eyebrow looked weirder than no eyebrows at all, so Alphie looked a lot funnier than Prosper.

It wasn’t hard to find the culprit. It was a senior they called Zuma — it’s kinda hard to pull off a hall of fame prank and shut up about it. His efforts earned him deboardinization, of course, but for what it’s worth, he seemed to enjoy becoming a day-student.

So, like everyone else, I got to prep, took one look at Alphie’s face and burst into a fit of laughter.

In all of this, there was a lesson to be learnt: during Akpakus, you better sleep with one eye open.

Sleeping With One Eye Open

(I actually saw someone do this once. It’s real creepy.)

There was a simple golden rule during Akpakus: Everything is legal, just DON’T GET CAUGHT. The implications were serious: everyone was fair game.

The story is told of one boy in Guggisberg house who woke up to find himself on his bed in the bathroom surrounded by twelve hooded men holding candles and chanting. The dude almost had a heart attack! He quoted every scripture he knew, and threw in “No woman no cry” for good measure. Imagine his surprise when they turned on the lights and he realised it was his dorm mates pranking him.

For those who didn’t have time for such sophisticated pranks, they worked with four main tools: water, powder, toothpaste and belts.

I’ve already explained how powder was used to dust people in their sleep; a slightly more wicked variation was the use of toothpaste to line the eyebrows. This happened to one Guggisberg boy called Ekome. Ekome woke up one morning and innocently rubbed his face with his palm, only to temporarily blind himself with minty Pepsodent toothpaste expertly laid on his eyebrows. Pepsodent in your eyes is no way to start your morning, especially when your dorm is upstairs and the taps are downstairs.

In Aggrey House, Umar, the sanctions monitor, was baptized in bed by a group of juniors. Of course, they were not dumb enough to do it directly; they placed a gallon of water on the empty bed planks above him while he slept, and then they went outside, passed a stick through the window, and tipped the gallon of water on top of him.

How I wish I could have done the same thing to the house prefect, but chale, like I keep saying, I was foolish, not an idiot.

The real go-getters were the belt wielders. These guys had personal vendettas to settle.

Me, I just used to tie people’s legs to their beds during Akpakus, nothing serious oo. But the guys who went about lashing people in their sleep… look at their nicknames: Obstinate, Immortal, Rokoto, Salageezy. I was not interested in their game. But to be safe, I began to go to bed with a belt in my hand.

One eye open chale, one eye open.

The bottom line is, Akpakus week was not safe. So when the end of the term was declared I felt I had achieved something. I could actually beat my chest and be proud. I’d survived one term in Motown! I’d survived an entire Akpakus week with both eyebrows! Now only one thing stood between me and my vacation: Akpakus Night.

Akpakus Night

Akpakus night was a simple game of “you snooze, you lose”. We did everything to stay awake, even playing football as late as 1 AM, but you can’t cheat Nature. There was actually an Aggrey boy called Nature, and you couldn’t cheat him either.

At 4:00 AM, so close to sunrise, and victory, my eyelids gave up on me and closed.

I woke up with a start at 5 AM and instinctively my hand moved to wipe my face.

Wait! I remembered Ekome. I touched my eyebrows, and just as I suspected, Pepsodent.

“Haha”, I laughed, “disaster avoided”.

I smiled and stood up, only to fall flat on my face. My leg had been tied to the bed. Karma really is a “beach”.

But at least I got to keep my eyebrows.

The Next Morning

There was an upside a few hours later, while heading to the dining hall for our parting breakfast.

“Kodzooooooo!” That sing-song voice that made my heart tingle.

“Akuaaaaaaaa!”, I sang right back, as I turned around to face the source of the voice. “You were allowed to cross over?”

“Yes oo”, she giggled, “Can anybody stop me?” Actually, everyone could cross over from the east to the west on vacation day. There were no functioning rules at this time.

Akua had a funny look in her eyes. “You forgot something.”

Ah? Me? Forgot something? I couldn’t think of anything, and the confusion showed on my face.

“My number, silly!”, she laughed, holding out a folded piece of paper.

I froze.

You see, I had a little secret. I’d never taken a gir’l’s number before.

There’s a perfectly good explanation: I did not own a phone. I simply did not know what to do with a girl’s number.

How was I supposed to call her? Was I even supposed t call her that night or wait till she missed me? Whose phone would I use?

“Wh-Wh-What network?” I know, lame right?

“MTN”, she responded with a quizzical look, “Why? What network do you use?”

“Oh, you’ll see”, I replied. I quickly took the piece of paper before she changed her mind.

“Kodzo, you’re weird”, she said playfully, “you’re lucky you’re cute”.

Herh, me tri mu yɛɛ me dɛ at once. Kyerɛ sɛ me yɛ cute boy. (Oh, yeah, not everyone speak Twi: I became light-headed because she called me cute.)

“I have to get going”, she said, walking away backwards and waving at close range. Typical Motown girl. Then as if on second thought, she came back and gave me a hug. This time I didn’t black out — I was a big boy.

She smelled like flowers 😉.

“Call me oo”, she prodded as she let me go.

“I will”, I responded. I didn’t know how, but I would find a way…

”You dey chop under school roof?!” the dorm monitor bellowed.

‘School roof’… How did these stupid terms creep into Motown?

There is an actual rule that you can’t eat in any space that has a roof (school roof) apart from the dining halls and chop box rooms. Like… why? Is eating out in the open a skill every student needs to learn?

“Go carry your scrubbing brush. You go scrub the dorm right now!”

“Kodzo! Kodzo! You’ll be late!” A new voice. Distant, like an echo.

Suddenly, everything faded into blackness.

Ugghh! I opened my eyes. It was mommy.

I let out a sigh.

Reopening day. No wonder I  was dreaming about scrubbing dorms.

I rolled over and planted my face in my pillow. It was still harmattan: the weather was deliciously cold, and nowhere was safe but my bed.

“Mmm mmm mmm-mmm mmmm.” The pillow muffled my words.

I tried again. “I don’t want to go.”

It turns out this was one of those days where you just don’t mess with mommy.

“I don’t have time for this”. And with that, she grabbed my leg and dragged me out of bed.

I never looked forward to school. At all.

It gave me this queasy, uneasy, bugs-in-my-tummy feeling, complete with a loss of appetite. The ‘ampedu’ in me was not interested in studying. Then there was the countless rules that rivaled the Old Testament. For example, I had to cut my hair.

Now, long before rasta men started taking Motown to court, students already hated compulsory haircuts. But it couldn’t be helped. The rule was the rule.

If you made the mistake of not cutting your hair before arriving in school, there’s a barber on the West called Apaa Dede. Every student who gets to Motown with bushy hair is sent to him before being allowed into their house.

If Apaa Dede touches your head, your life will never be the same. Nobody ever went to him and came back with a straight hairline.

My actual barber was a friendly guys, but not that day. That day, he was the enemy.

“Lower?” He asked.

“Lower”, I confirmed, watching my nice vacation afro disappear in my reflection in the mirror.

Better here than at the hands of Apaa Dede.

I shifted my mind to a more comforting thought. Akua.

The boy in the mirror smiled back at me at the thought. A very foolish smile.

Young love, eh?

The second term of form 1 is arguably more of a headache than the first: there is no grace period; you cannot use “I did not know” as an excuse, and your course syllabus begins to get tougher. In fact, it’s worse if you enjoyed your Christmas break: you’ll literally feel like you’re being moved into a concentration camp.

Not fun, chale. Not fun.

I was going to be showering with cold water during the harmattan for the first time in my life. I was not excited.

Some people felt they needed a few more days at home. That, my friends, was a silly decision. You see, we had been warned at closing assembly the previous term by one of the assistant headmistresses, “Any student who fails to report on the first day of school will undergo two weeks of internal suspension.”

This internal suspension, inte (pronounced in-teh) as we called it, was not a joke. All defaulters were prevented from attending class for two whole weeks within which they did nothing but weed.

Oh, I’m sorry, not just weed, some were made to chop down actual trees and break ant-hills.

It didn’t matter whether you were a day late or a month late, every latecomer would weed for two weeks.

If you absolutely had to come to school late, you had two options:

    1. Get a doctor’s report saying you reported late for health reasons. Or…

    2. Go BIG — come to school like three weeks late. I mean, what’s the point of being punished for two weeks for a two-day crime?

The return to Aggrey House was a bitter experience.

Once I saw the dead lawns my mind was flooded with memories of carrying gallons of water morning and evening.

You wanted to shower? Gallon.

You wanted to wash? Gallon.

You wanted to poop? You guessed it. Gallon.

My dad parked in front of the house as usual. This time, there were no form 2 students to carry our things. You had to go grab a couple of your friends to help you.

Of course, Smizzle and Eben were there to collect their house development funds, which, surprise surprise, did not seem to be leading to any development.

After the sweaty work of lifting chopbox and trunk to their respective locations, I got a small wad of cash from my old man and then watched a little sadly as he drove off.

Another three months of torment, I thought to myself.

DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! The big ol’ school bell rang from the bell tower. it was time to head to the dining hall.

The rule for the first dining of every term is “Eat as little as possible”.

It’s the one time you can waste food and get away with it. Heck, if you eat from the dining hall on the first night, people might think you are homeless.

Most students are wise enough to have their last supper and then some before they come to school. If you know the Bible story, it’s a ‘five wise virgins’ thing. Some would go as far as to pack and store home-chow to be aired throughout the night and eaten the next morning.

If you wanted to go gung-ho, you could skip dining all together and no one would bat an eyelid, but that would mean missing out on vacation gossip. Who had travelled where? Who had been to which party? Who had crashed their parents’ car? You know, important stuff, just not so important that I have to bore you with the details now.

Once dining was over, Obodai and I headed back to my dorm. He had saved some Papye fried rice which we were going to destroy.

The food was so good, we didn’t talk for a while. We just stuffed our faces amidst and let out the occasional sigh of contentment.

So I was very surprised when he broke the silence with “So you call am?”

“Huh?” I replied.

He persited. “You call am?”

“Mmm-mmm. Who?” I asked. I was focused on a piece of chicken wedged in a tricky spot between two bones.

“Akua.”

I stopped chewing. “Ermmm, yes and no.”

Obodai face-palmed, like I was the biggest idiot in the history of idiots. “Explain.”

“Sooooooo”, I began, “you knoooooow, eeeeeerm…”

“Hey, hey! Cut to the chase.” I don’t even know why he was getting so worked up.

“Alright. Sheesh. Relax for me.”

Obodai met me with a blank stare.

I continued. “So I called, okay, I called. You know I don’t have a phone, so I used my mum’s phone when she was not looking.”

“And?” Obodai asked impatiently.

“Well, a macho man picked. I think it was her dad, and-”

“What?!” Obodai cut me off. “How did you know it was her dad, much less a macho man?”

“The voice was husky, okay?” I shot back.

“Husky? That’s all you’ve got? Husky?” Obodai seemed genuinely disappointed in me.

“Yes. Husky.” That really was all I had.

“And then what?” he asked, still shocked at my “ballslessness”, for lack of a more apt adjective.

“And then I said ‘Sorry, wrong number’ and cut the call.”

By this point, even I was embarrassed for me.

“Kodzo, sometimes you make me sick, you know? Please tell me you tried calling again.”

“Ermmm, nope? It’s my mum’s phone la.” That was my best explanation.

“But the vacation lasted a whole month. You couldn’t call on Christmas, or even New Year’s? Did you even leave a text?”

“So that the macho man could identify me and hunt me down for chasing his daughter? No please.”

At this point Obodai was dumbfounded. He had not anticipated having to process this amount of stupidity on the first day of a new term.

“You need help. You know that?” I could see that he meant it.

“No, I need a phone.”

“And that would solve the ‘macho man’ problem?” He actually motioned with his fingers when he said ‘macho man’. “You know what? I’m done with you.”

He got up and walked off, mumbling something about me needing diving intervenion for my love-life.

I was left alone with my thoughts and one last piece of chicken.

He did have a point. Husky didn’t have to mean macho. I mean, I knew girls with husky voices and they didn’t look like they could beat me or anything.

I forced the thought out of my mind to focus on the other matter at hand; the last piece of chicken.

Let tomorrow worry about itself, I reassured myself. The words fo Jesus. If they were good enough for my Lord, they were good enough for me. And then I sank my teeth into the last piece of chicken.

“Herh! Kodzo!”

“Are you eating under school roof?! Go carry your scrubbing brush. You go scrub the dorm right now!”

YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!

First things first, my results came during the vacation, and I aced everything — even that chemistry paper that threatened my sanity the previous term.

The other thing was that I would finally get to see Akua again. 😍

I couldn’t wait to hear her sing out “Kodzoooooo” again. Lowkey, I’d been doing a countdown to reopening because of her. It was like this this girl had bewitched me or something.

Now of course, there was the small issue of how I would explain not being able to speak with her during the vacation. But she would understand, right? Right? 😅

The first few days saw us doing a lot of clean-ups.

Before global warming was very evident, you could trust the harmattan to coat all the tables and chairs with dust. We had to sweep and scrub our classrooms; sweep and scrub our seniors’ classrooms; sweep and scrub our dorms; sweep and scrub the dining hall… you get the picture, we swept and scrubbed anything that could be swept and/or scrubbed.

I promise, form 1 is a disease if not a curse.

All this time, the easterners worked on the eastern compound, and the westerners worked on their compound. For two whole days I didn’t see my Akua, and these seniors were still annoying me, but hallelujah, classes were scheduled to start on Thursday!

Wait, that came out wrong.

I can’t have you thinking I enjoyed academics. My ampedu levels were significantly up there, but I was just waiting for class as an excuse to see Akua.

No, seriously, I should really consider this bewitchment theory.

According to Obodai, I mentioned her name in my dreams. Twice.

It’s not easy oo, it’s not easy.

Ladies and gentlemen, Thursday finally came, the official first day of class, and I was ready. Oh, how I bathed with that icy water that cold cold harmattan morning. I pressed my shomi — deodorant — unsparingly, filling the dorm with the aroma of “AXE Dark Temptation”.

chop box life axe dark temptation

I put on my uniform (ironed and re-ironed the night before) and walked out of the house feeling like a million cedis.

In the chapel, at morning assembly, I was looking out for her gidigidi.

I saw her, but she didn’t see me. Chale, as if she wasn’t fine enough last term, the vacation change-in-diet had brought out this glow all over her. Also, because of the dryness of the harmattan, lip balm was allowed, so her lips were glistening, sokyee.

Hey! Kodzo! Get a grip, chale.

She was too far off anyway, and she was giggling with her friends, four other girls I’d noticed around her on a few occasions. I decided to wait till break time to go and say hi.

Arts 4 was just above Science 4 anyway.

That morning, we didn’t have lessons straight away: we had a meeting with our form-masters to evaluate our individual performances from the first term.

There are no class-teachers in Motown. The closest thing is a form-master or form-mistress, a teacher responsible for the ‘academic well-being’ of your class. Think of them like your academic babysitters, who do their babysitting once a term.

Science 4’s form-master was Azotobacter, a macho agriculture teacher. He was a really chill guy. His favourite example of nitrogen-fixing bacteria was Azotobacter, and that’s how he got his name.

If you called him Azotobacter to his face, it was at your own risk.

Some people had not received their reports in the mail like I had, so that morning was the first time some would be seeing their results. We’d walk up to Azotobacter at the front of the class, one after another and stand next to him while he mused over our results.

It turns out I was the only one in my class to make straight A’s that term. Azotobacter was impressed.

I got an enthusiastic “More grease to your elbows” and a handshake out of him.

The next time I would have straight A’s was three years later in my final WASSCE exams.

I got back to my seat and was doing my own thing when I heard, “Foolish boy!!” followed by what sounded like two punches. Yup, someone’s results were really bad, and the macho man effected instant justice. For the sake of avoiding a lawsuits, I’ll not be mentioning any names.

The problem with doing well publicly is that you can’t celebrate while others are sad.

While I had my good results, others had two or more red circles, and would not be going home on account of Atico.

It was a sobering moment, but I was determined not to let anything put me down. I had to have a smile for Akua.

DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! The old school bell rang.

My people, it was time.

My hour had come.

My moment was here.

I began to feel a little pressure building, but like King David, I encouraged myself in the Lord.

Obodai was the only one who knew my plans. I looked at him with all intensity, and uttered these fateful words, “It’s about to go down”.

Little did I know how true those words were.

I got up from my desk and began my walk upstairs.

Why were my palms and armpits suddenly so sweaty?

AXE Dark Temptation was failing me. But chale, I couldn’t turn back now.

Sooner than I expected I was in front of 1 Arts 4. This was the moment. This was my time. I stepped into the class…

Something was off. Akua was not at her usual seat.

I quickly scanned the classroom and noticed her sitting in a corner with her friend. I think her name was Ama. Both their eyes were red, like they had been crying.

Every fibre of my being screamed, “LEAVE!!! Save yourself!”

I could. They hadn’t seen me.

I walked right over. Foolish boy.

My mind raced. Had the worst happened? Could it be? Did my Akua drop Atico?

My heart pounded with every step.

I got to the desk and she finally saw me. Sorry, they saw me.

Akua didn’t even smile; that was a first. She must be really upset, I thought.

“Oh, Akua, what’s the matter?” I asked with all the concern in the world.

“Ama dropped Atico”, she sniffled.

In the next eight seconds, I attained the height of stupidity.

First of all, Ama seemed kind of annoyed that Akua just gave me such privileged information, however, if that was all I had to deal with I would have been fine. It’s what happened next that killed me.

“Oh, thank God! I thought it was you.”

You see, I told you. Foolishness.

To be fair, I thought I was thinking it. I don’t know how my tongue decided to speak those thoughts.

I wish I could have swallowed those words. I wish they had remained in my mind. Heck, I wish I just stayed put in my class, because what happened next…

I need to take a break. I’m shy. 😕

To be continued…

Akua was not at her usual seat.

I quickly scanned the classroom and noticed her sitting in a corner with her friend. I think her name was Ama. Both their eyes were red, like they had been crying.

Every fibre of my being screamed, “LEAVE!!! Save yourself!”

I could. They hadn’t seen me.

I walked right over. Foolish boy.

My mind raced. Had the worst happened? Could it be? Did my Akua drop Atico?

My heart pounded with every step.

I got to the desk and she finally saw me. Sorry, they saw me.

Akua didn’t even smile; that was a first. She must be really upset, I thought.

“Oh, Akua, what’s the matter?” I asked with all the concern in the world.

“Ama dropped Atico”, she sniffled.

Ama seemed kind of annoyed that Akua just gave me such privileged information, however, if that was all I had to deal with I would have been fine. It’s what happened next that killed me.

“Oh, thank God! I thought it was you.”

Time froze…

The gravity of my words dawned on me immediately: I’d messed up.

I had been insensitive towards Ama, I’d insinuated that I thought Akua was possibly a poor student, and I’d done all this right in front of both of them.

My tongue got all tied up. I tried to explain; I tried to apologize, but I just stuttered. “Akua- I- I- … Ama, I didn’t mean- I- I’m- I-”

Usually this would make her laugh. Not today.

“Kodzo,” Akua cut me off, “I think you need to leave.”

Herh! My chest!

It wasn’t so much about about her asking me to leave; it was how she said it.

She seemed so… so disappointed. Like tolerating my presence any longer was exhausting.

How I wish she would have lost her cool: I could have had a basis to play a can’t-you-take-a-joke card. Her diplomacy disarmed me. Ama wasn’t helping either, she just turned on the water-works. Akua hugged her tight.

I can’t stand to see girls cry.

“I’m sorry”, I offered, then I turned and left quietly.

This is not how our second term was supposed to start.

The weeks that followed were disheartening to say the least. Akua wouldn’t talk to me. In fact, her whole posse wanted nothing to do with me: she had these four friends she rolled with, including Ama. The term before,they used to giggle whenever I was close by. This time around, it was just cold silence, or at best an occasional “Mtcheeew”; teeth-kissing that was obviously meant for me.

I tried sending notes. If Akua ever saw them, she never replied.

As far as I was concerned, all hope was lost. I tried to stay sane by occupying myself: I even joined the Motown cadet (story for another day), but nothing seemed to work. Deep down I was heart-broken, and it was all because of my big fat mouth.

Everyday felt like a rainy day.

Ewwww, I feel like I’m writing a soap opera now.

Weeks had passed.

It was break time. I was sitting in my class with a loss appetite and trying to solve a three-set Venn diagram problem: I had to do something with my life.

“Kodzo.”

I looked up, quite startled. It was one of Akua’s friends, Nhyira. Actually, they called her ‘Nhyie’, but that was just them being bougie.

“Oh, hi Nhyie”, I began, “what brings you here? Am I in anymore trouble?”

“Shut up and scoot over”, she commanded, “I can’t afford to be seen with you for long; you’re the enemy.”

I obliged, and she squeezed her small frame next to me behind my desk.

“First of all”, she started, “let’s lay a good foundation: you’re a fool, and you hurt my friends.”

Ouch! For a tiny person, she was quite assertive. I’m not one to diss myself, but she was right. I just wished they would stop making me feel bad for it; I’d already beaten myself up over it.

“But I like you”, she continued, “and-”

She saw the look of confusion on my face. “Don’t be silly”, she addressed my thoughts, “Not the way you’re thinking. You’re not my type. I don’t do lanky.”

Did I feel insulted? Heavens no! I was relieved. You should be familiar with my qualms about short people. I mean, petite is cute, but not Nhyie!

“Anyway”, she continued, “I like you, and I can see you’ve been a little distressed, so I’ve decided to help you make amends with Tabitha.” (That’s Akua’s first name, in case you forgot.) “You can thank me later. Val’s day is coming; prepare yourself and wait for further instructions. Don’t contact me, I’ll contact you.”

And with that, the little lady got up and left. A woman who could take charge; I liked that, although she legit scared me.

“Prepare yourself…” I was not sure what that meant. I would later learn that Valentine’s Day is a day to be approached with a lot of financial caution, especially in the area of savings.

The problem was, this happened on Wednesday, and Valentine’s was going to be on Sunday. How was I going to be ready in four days? This was obviously not Nhyira’s problem.

The next day, I saw a note on my desk. In a very neat handwriting, it read:

    Deliverables:

    1. A bar of chocolate, preferably Mars or Snickers (Kingsbite is unacceptable, but Pebbles may suffice)

    2. A very beautiful card with a poem in it (MUST be perfumed)

    3. If you can get a teddy bear or a cake (complete with icing) you’re redeemed. This is optional, but how bad do you want this?

    All the best,

    N.

My heart skipped a beat when I read number 3. Teddy bear?! Cake?! Did this Nhyira girl want to kill me?

It was clear what I had to do. I walked up to Sandra, Science 4’s chief day student and almost literally emptied my wallet. I added my orders to the list of items she had on a foolscap sheet.

A lot of boarders had already contracted her to acquire certain merchandise before the weekend.

Sandra had only one rule: she did not return change. She had been buying waakye for the boarding house students for months, and she never defaulted on this golden rule. I was never going to see that money again.

Sandra walked into the chapel late on Friday morning. Her bag was conspicuously bigger, and she seemed to be struggling under it’s weight. My stuff (and that of many others) was in.

An hour later, I had safely retrieved two snicker bars from Sandra, and a beautiful card if I say so myself. After months of smuggling waakye, she was very professional in her dealings so nobody saw the transaction, plus she added a beautiful gift bag which I hadn’t thought about. Talk about a woman’s touch. Things were going according to plan.

I spent all two hours of Saturday morning prep crafting the best poem I could. There’s no Google in Motown, and I couldn’t tell anyone. I was on my own.

A lot of you are thinking, “Oh, but you are a good writer.”

Ha! Now… I am a good writer now. Two hours of writing did not cut it for me at age 15.

At the end of prep, I went to 1 Arts 1 to see Danny, a Livingstone House boy, for help. I’d heard he was good with literature, and a bit of a romantic. He was still in class. Yes!

I quickly introduced myself and explained that I needed a poem.

“Are there any special details to be considered in writing this poem?”, Danny asked me.

What? Details? My confusion was obvious.

“Yes, details”, he answered the questioning look on my face. “I need to make it more personal for you. Her name, maybe?”

“Errmmm, I can’t give you that”, I replied, “I need to keep this hush-hush.”

“My friend, help me to help you”, was his curt reply.

“Oh chale, make you no bore. Don’t you have anything generic? Any old poems that are still gold?” I asked hopefully.

Danny thought for a while. “There just might be one.”

He pulled out an old notebook and flipped through till he found what he was looking for. “Aha! I wrote this a while back.”

I skimmed through the poem quickly. The title was Tell Her But Don’t Let Her Know. It had an air of mystery about it, and it was really deep… so deep I didn’t understand half of it 😂. It started like this:

    She wants to know who she is

    With every single stare

    In my eyes like the wiz

    With patience and with care…

    (You can read the rest online. Yup! It’s a real poem)

“I like this one”, I half-exclaimed.

“Good. That will be ten cedis.”

Ei, this guy. “Ow, bro. Wo nua ne me oo. Help a brother out”, I begged.

His reply was pretty funny, “Normally, I would, but I wrote this poem with sweat and tears. It’s not free.”

Herh! The guy had a look I couldn’t bargain with. I pulled out my last five cedis. “Chale, my last this. Adey beg waaaaa.”

He seemed so insulted. Without another word, he picked up his bag and notebook and left. Talk about dramatic.

I was back to square one.

The day was here. I had two bars of candy and a beautiful card, but no poem.

At breakfast, people were eating chocolate. The sermon in the chapel that morning was about love. The girls oohed and aahed throughout.

I got to my desk after the service and found a note from Nhyira:

    Bring the stuff to SU today.

    I hope you wrote a killer poem. She’s a sucker for those.

    N.

My heart sunk, I couldn’t even study. I just slept.

A funny thing happened during lunch with this third-year girl in MacCarthy House who was really popular.

I was sitting at the Aggrey form one table sulking when I heard a loud shout followed by a stream of insults.

Everyone’s attention shifted. Here’s what had happened:

Some form one boy, someone’s poor child, had been sent to deliver a cake to this girl as a Valentine’s Day gift. However, the cake was made of gari, and her name was written on it in red toothpaste. A gari-and-toothpaste cake was a really big insult,the lowest of practical jokes.

The girl insulted the boy till he ran away. The whole dining hall erupted in laughter.

As for me, a lightbulb came on in my head. Laughter! So I couldn’t write a deep poem, who cares? Maybe I can write a funny poem.

I decided to write a limerick, you know, one of those funny five-line verses with an AABBA rhyme scheme.

I had an hour to come up with five lines to make Akua smile. Anything for those dimples, chale, anything.

And so I thought… and thought… and thought… and thought… all through siesta period, I thought.

Finally, at 2:55pm, with just five minutes left till the start of SU, I penned my limerick down, borrowed Gbewee’s shomi, and perfumed that card well-well. I sealed it in the pink envelope that came with it, and wrote legibly on the front: AKUA.

I dropped it in the gift bag with the Snicker bars and dashed off to SU.

Nhyira was waiting for me near one of the assembly hall entrances.

As soon as she saw me, she frowned. “I don’t see a teddy bear, or a cake”, she stated. “People are smuggling in necklaces and rose bouquets, and you couldn’t get a common teddy bear?”

This girl was determined to give me grief, but she was not lying: with my own eyes I saw that someone had bought a G-string for a girl, and I’m not referring to guitar strings here.

A high school student buying G-strings, oh well, I was not his father.

So what if I couldn’t get her a hand-drawn portrait like everyone else? I decided to trust in my Snicker bars and poetry bars.

“It was the best I could do on such short notice”, I explained.

“Oh well, let’s pray it’s enough. Also, if this works, you owe me big time”, she threatened, as she grabbed the bag from me and walked away.

My part was done. At this point I could only cross my fingers and pray. Where better to pray than SU? I entered the assembly hall and joined the opening prayers with all vim and vigour. My story had to change, by thunder, by fire!

Y’all didn’t read my limerick yet. * clears throat *

    I’ve been silly, my speech was improper,

    When I see you I get nervous and stutter,

    But the last time I tried,

    I made Ama cry,

    I’m sorry. What is life without Aqua Akua?

    Forgive me, Kodzo

Not bad for my first poem, huh?

That’s why we were suffering; dead people.

Founders’ Day is a day set aside to honour the people who made Motown what it is, especially the big three, the men who built the school out of nothing, thereby earning their positions on the school cloth; a boulevard each in their honour; a house named after each of them, oh, and a place in the hearts of many colonial-era Ghanaians.

I am talking about Kwegyir Aggrey, Gordon Guggisberg, and Alex Fraser, the founding fathers of Motown.

Every year, on Founders’ Day, during the first weekend in March, Motown goes into a celebratory mood. The year groups from twenty-five and fifty years earlier (1985 and 1960 respectively back in 2010) come and handle the celebrations.

Old students come around and we have a torchlight procession that ends in a big ol’ bonfire night.

By torchlight, I don’t mean flashlight; we don’t roll like that. I mean actual fire. We can’t use flashlights to light a bonfire, now can we?

Then there’s a big cadet parade and traditional durbar, which, for whatever reason, Ghanaian presidents and ministers love to attend.

The senior boys are made to run around bare-chested, smeared in baby oil, while singing some weird songs nobody remembers a week later.

You should have seen the workouts Gbewee and the rest did in anticipation.

If you had man-boobs, your dignity was at stake, but if you showed up with a solid chest and a six-pack, it was the best day of your life! The girls would line up to take pictures with you, and rub their hands against your rock-solid abs. Good times, chale, good times.

The celebration ends with a beautiful Thanksgiving service at the Aggrey chapel on Sunday. It’s generally a fun weekend, but the work that has to be put in beforehand is pretty much “hellish”, to say the least.

This, my dear friends, plus my mildly broken heart, is why I joined Motown’s cadet corps.

I’d tried the cadet thing in basic school: marching wasn’t that hard, plus I became assistant band major, which was kind of cool.

However, I never wanted to become a soldier, except for a few brief moments of childish excitement while I was watching G.I. Joe. That lasted what, like thirty minutes?

The point is, I had no interest whatsoever in military matters, not to talk of the cadet, which I pretty much considered playing “military pretend”.

So how exactly did I end up in the Motown Cadet Corps?

Meet General Bombo.

Bombo was a “senior-senior”. Get it? He’d had to retake his senior year.

Bombo was the cadet commander, hence the title ‘General’. ‘Bombo’ was his favourite alternative cuss word. So if he ever said “Bombo you”, he was probably cussing you out.

Also, remember that I was in a weird emotional state: Akua was not talking to me, she had been avoiding me for weeks, so I was gullible and in need of some companionship. Now, back to what Bombo said…

“Cadets no dey work on Saturdays oo.”

He wasn’t even talking to me. He was trying to convince someone else to join the cadets. I didn’t care.

“Ah, Bombo”, I asked, “you make serious? Cadets no dey job Saturdays?”

“Yeah”, he replied, “we dey jog, so you’ll be exempted from work.”

Where you see laziness, I saw an opportunity. No work? I didn’t even hear the jogging bit.

“Oh saa, I’ll be there next week”, I said, and just like that, I became a member of the cadet corps.

My joining the cadet meant that I wouldn’t be part of the Founders’ Day tribal procession, or tribal war, as we called it, during the durbar that year.

This was a good thing because of how tribal war worked: all students would be pseudo-randomly divided into five ethnic groups; Akan, Ewe, Fante, Ga and Northern. Then for like a month, we would spend our time, almost every day after class, learning songs in languages we did not understand and their accompanying dances.

It was stress.

Also, ‘shaku-shaku’ had not been invented so I could not dance. At all.

As if that wasn’t enough, they put me, Ewe boy, in the Northern tribe.

I was so annoyed: first of all, the north is not a tribe, duh, it is a geographical direction.

Secondly, and still related to the first point, the north had so many tribes, and so many languages, that I felt I was learning to sing in tongues.

The third reason was really the simplest, their dances were just too hard. So much jumping and twisting and turning, there was even one dance where you had to jump and use your knees to touch your shoulders. You read that right. My lanky frame could not keep up.

I chose marching over dancing right away. Of course, this meant that on Saturdays, I was up at 5AM jogging around the second largest senior high school campus in Ghana.

We didn’t only jog; we would ‘shii jama’: the art of musical noise-making with loud clapping and shouting of what was often carefully disguised profanity. When I finally understood some of the words I’d been singing I bought mouthwash.

The comradery was solid though, and every Saturday morning as we jogged past the headmistress’ house we would sing about how the dining hall food sucked.

It’s funny, Motown is actually known to have the best D-hall food in Ghana… but students can’t be pleased.

Our favourite song had the lines “Koko bebree eskyire nni mu” and “Bolus bebree ɛnyɛ dɛ“, which translate to “Lots of porridge, no sugar” and “Lots of kenkey, doesn’t taste good.”

However, contrary to Bombo’s advertisement, Eben, the Aggrey house prefect, didn’t give two hoots about the cadets. I always came back tired from jogging and still had to scrub. I knew in my heart of hearts that I was in the middle of my first and last term in the cadet corps.

In fact, the only thing that kept me there was my phobia for northern dances. The next year I would just swerve the northerners and work my way into the Fante tribe, but there was no way I was going to stay a cadet after that year’s parade was over.

And so the day arrived, we put on our uniforms and marched in the morning, then we stood under the hot sun for close to two hours, because apparently if you can do that, you can go to war.

Now I should let you know that my foot size is 45.5 (EUR). The biggest boots the cadets had were size 44. I almost died standing in those tight boots. Everyone was watching too; all these nice girls. I couldn’t be the boy who toppled over and disgraced himself. Abi you guys know me… haaaaaaard guy.

I lie! Come and see me praying, “Father, your Word says, ‘Let he who thinks he stands be careful, lest he fall.’ Daddy, give me grace to stand.”

Nobody can tell me God doesn’t answer prayer, because, my people, I stood. Hallelujah!

I felt like those dadaba kids who sing the “Ring a Ring o’ Roses” nursery rhyme and then end it with an enthusiatic “I didn’t fall down! I didn’t fall down!” I was pumped!

And just as we ended, as I was about to kick off my one-and-half-size-too-small boots and blow air on my cramped toes, she showed up…

Yup!

Akua showed up. And she was smiling! I mean, it wasn’t a full grin, she looked sort of amused, but I could see dimples 😍. After almost a month of icy coldness, dimples at last!!!

But I had to be careful. I’d made too many mistakes already; I contained my excitement.

“A man in a uniform. Nice”, she remarked, “You were looking good out there. How come you didn’t tell me you were a cadet?”

REALLY?! REEEEAAALLYYYYY???!!! After weeks of pretending I didn’t exist, how come I didn’t what?! This girl paahn.

But I kept my cool. “Thanks, it’s not a big deal.”

I treid to be modest, and I intentionally avoided her question. I wasn’t going to be extra today. Plus I could feel my toes going into the foot version of a cardiac arrest. I began to lightly shift my weight from foot to foot, doing everything possible so I wouldn’t fall over right there and then. I’d already dropped my rifle, so I had nothing to lean on. We used real guns by the way.

“So, ermm, I got your ‘poem'”, she laughed as she did actual air-quotes. Then the funniest thing happened: she quoted my limerick word for word:

    “I’ve been silly, my speech was improper,

    When I see you I get nervous and stutter,

    But the last time I tried,

    I made Ama cry,

    I’m sorry. What is life without Aqua”

“You memorized it?” I asked in shock.

“Well, it did have a nice ring to it, plus I’ve had two weeks of practice.”

This girl had me confused. Two weeks without a reply, and all of a sudden, poetry recital? I just couldn’t understand.

“Oh, cool”, I said, a little uncertain. “I should let you know though, these boots are killing my feet right now, and there’s a hole in my socks that I don’t want you to see, so I have to get out of here right now.”

She thought I was being funny. You should have seen my socks.

“I’ll see you around?” I asked.

She nodded in affirmation. It looked like I’d been forgiven, but I was starting to get weird vibes about this girl’s emotional balance. I’d have to be careful.

Fortunately for me, Aggrey house is right next to the cadet square, so I was able to walk to the house and pull off those demonic boots before my feet became worthy of amputation.

I was so done with the cadets.

I thought I’d had enough Akua drama for the day. Boy, was I wrong.

By 3 PM the durbar had started. It was a colourful myriad of Ghanaian culture and Motown traditions: people were singing, and dancing, and chanting, and cheering, and then the Akan lead dancers took the floor. Akua was one of them.

When you hear the term “graceful dancer”, do you understand? No, you do not.

If you have not seen Akua dance the Adowa, you have not seen a graceful dancer.

Herh! The girl can daaaaance! And because she was in traditional dancing garb, not her usual buoyant uniform I saw something about her I’d never seen before: curves.

I was smitten. Chai! 😍

Seeing her move was like watching a musical plotting of a sine wave. If ever I have felt bewitchment, it must have been then.

My eyes were fixed on her as I watched from the sidelines. Then for a brief moment, she looked in my direction — our eyes locked, and then she winked.

She winked oo! Like, she winked la!

My brain scattered.

Two boys behind me began to argue over whom she had winked at. They wished.

At the end of the durbar, as I made my way towards the dining hall for supper with Obodai, I heard my name, “Kodzoooo!”

Obodai just sighed and left. I think he was tired of me always ditching him first.

I turned around, and sure enough, it was Akua, still in the traditional Akan attire.

“So”, she began, “earlier today, I meant to say that I overreacted, and I haven’t been fair to you. Also, Nhyie put in a few good words for you, and that poem was funny. So yeah, I’m sorry for getting so worked up for so long.” Then she leaned close enough that I could feel her breath and whispered, “I think it’s the hormones. Puberty is tough.”

I burst out laughing. That was the funniest thing I’d heard all week.

“Alright”, I agreed, “we’ll blame the hormones. But you were great out there today oo.”

“Thanks”, she replied with a shy smile. You could tell that she already knew she was a very good dancer.

“‘Bithaaaa! We have to go.”

It was Nhyira. I smiled at her. She’d come through after all.

She smiled back and waved, then Akua said good bye and turned to head to the West with her friend.

If I continued to watch her from behind as she walked away in that dress (or more accurately, cloth), my mind would have roamed into uncharted waters. I turned away out of respect and ran to catch up with Obodai.

Good things happen on Founders’ Day.

He walked up to our table with his weird mix of confident stride and subtle limp.

There we sat, sixteen scared boys looking up at the person who was literally the hardest guy in Motown.

“Gentleman.” He pronounced the word really fast, so it sounded like ‘jerilman‘.

“Jerilman“, he said, pointing at my plate, “Is that your food?”

I gulped, Jona snickered.

You should have seen me sweating.

I was finished.

Today, Motown has four dining halls: two on the East, and two on the West. Back in 2010, there were just two.

Anyhoo, in the main eastern dining hall, the tables were arranged in three rows: A, B and C. Each row had twenty tables, numbered 1 — close to the prefects’ high table — through 20 — all the way at the back, and close to the door.

The first table I was assigned was table C19, next to last on the C-row, and right next to a window. On that table were sixteen Aggrey house boys, all of us ravenous and consistently famished from being overworked in the hands of Eben and Smizzle.

As with everything in Motown, there were strict rules in the D-hall. First of all, nobody was allowed to start eating until the senior prefect rang the bell. As a matter of fact, the senior prefect rang the bell five times during every dining session:

The first ring meant “start serving”; the second was for us to rise and pray, or more accurately, say “Amen” to someone’s prayer and start eating; the third was for us to stop eating and start clearing their tables; the fourth was for us to quiet down and listen to announcements, and the last one was for us to stand up and say “Amen” to another prayer. It was the most organized approach to food I’d ever seen.

It’s worth noting that in Motown, with the exception of bread, you had to eat everything with a fork and knife.

“Even kenkey?” you ask. Especially kenkey. I know, bougie, right?

Another thing is that every table had a table-head and assistant. These people were responsible for serving food and ensuring that the table was cleared at the end of every meal. Almost every high school in Ghana has the same kind of dining hall pans. Whoever controlled the pan was king or queen on their table.

There was no way sixteen Aggrey boys were going to leave our nutritional fates in the hands of two people. And so we came to a very political three-step compromise:

    First, we would distribute the seven days of the week among fourteen of us. Two people were not interested in serving anyway.

    Secondly, whoever served was allowed to heap food onto their plates on their assigned day. Everyone who served would get their chance.

    Finally, whoever served had to clear the table that day. Oh, and our seniors’ tables in addition… first year was slavery, chale.

Based on this arrangement, I really can’t remember who the original table-heads were. We had new table-heads every day of the week, and my day was Tuesday.

Why Tuesday? Simple: gɔbɛ (pronounced ‘gor-berh’). Sweet sweet gɔbɛ, although we called it ‘agbaan‘ back then.

We had gɔbɛ for lunch on Tuesdays, and that was all that mattered to me.

I don’t think you understand my passion for gɔbɛ. It’s quite possible that I made a natural transition from breast milk to gɔbɛ as a toddler. It is etched into my earliest memories from as young as two years old. In fact, the only thing that I’ll ever allow to come between me and my gɔbɛ is a spoon. You can quote me.

A friend of mine, we call him Energy, has a name for people like me: Goblins.

I pray for you right now, that you too will become a goblin. Can I hear an “Amen”?

In fact, according to the Good News Translation of Genesis 25:29, Esau gave up his birthright for gɔbɛ: “One day while Jacob was cooking some bean [gɔbɛ] soup, Esau came in from hunting. He was hungry” (Gen 25:29 – GNT, emphasis mine)

It’s that good. So don’t be so hard on Esau for selling his birthright… he didn’t stand a chance. Esau was the first Goblin.

Now back to the story.

It started like any other Tuesday, Jona and I, the Tuesday table-heads, shared porridge in the morning, then we went to class, had a boring day and returned to the dining hall in the afternoon. It was gɔbɛ time.

As was the custom, we served everyone the bare minimum: one ladle of beans and one finger of fried plantain. The rest was ours. All ours! I kid you not, I just smelled beans while writing this!!

Ladle after ladle, we scooped the beans with gusto, heaping our plates like we never had before. My plate was almost overflowing. All my senses were involved: I could feel the heat from the plate; I saw the oil glistening in the pan; I could smell the aroma, heck I could taste it, and I began to hear the beans call my name, “Kodzo, Kodzooo, Kodzoooooo”.

All my senses, chale, all my senses.

I was just waiting for the senior prefect to ring the bell so I could dig in. Damn, this food was in trouble.

Clang! Clang! “Please rise for the first grace!” the dining hall prefect shouted. He didn’t have to say it twice. I was up, almost drooling.

“For what we’re about to have, we thank You, oh Lord!” he prayed.

“Amen!” I replied enthusiastically, as I sat down and pulled out my fork and knife.

All of a sudden, the table became uneasily quiet. Something was up. I turned around, and my heart skipped a beat.

Walking down our isle with his weird mix of confident stride and subtle limp was Boti, the sanctions prefect, also know as ‘Bow-Tie’.

Boti was the kind of guy whose presence made you hold your breath. Literally. We were afraid to breathe too hard around him.

It looked like he was just walking past, and then all of a sudden he stopped and began to gravitate towards C19. There we sat, sixteen scared boys looking up at the person who was literally the hardest guy in Motown. The rumours of how he got that limp varied depending on who you spoke to, but the one I chose to believe was that he got it from wrestling with an angel, like Jacob in the Bible.

“Gentleman”. He pronounced the word really fast, so it sounded like ‘jerilman‘.

“Jerilman“, he said, pointing at my plate, “Is that your food?”

I gulped; Jona snickered. He had craftily hidden his equally overflowing plate behind the serving pan. You should have seen me sweating. I was finished.

“I said, is that your food?” he repeated the question calmly. Too calmly.

“Y-y-yes please. A-a-a-any problem?” I stuttered.

He almost laughed. “No problem at all.”

Then with his left hand he pointed at my plate, and with his right hand he pointed at another guy’s plate (the guy was called Onero), then he crossed his hands. It looked like he was trying to do the Macarena dance.

I didn’t understand. I stared at him with a blank expression on my face.

He did it again.

I was still blank.

And then he spoke a word that sent a shiver down my spine:

Ehnn?! Ex-what?! I wanted to cry.

I know I’ve made all this noise about “The only thing that will come between me and my gɔbɛ is a spoon”, and obviously Boti was not a spoon, but I couldn’t do anything about it. The C19 boys laughed me to scorn as I passed my plate to Onero and took his measly portion.

Boti smiled, like he had just ‘Thanos snapped’ the world into order, and walked off to wherever he was going before he decided to ruin my life.

I couldn’t lift my head. I just looked down at the sad plate of beans in front of me. Me paa me nie?

Onero amazed me in that moment. As soon as Boti was out of sight, he swapped the plates back and winked at me. “My day go come”, he laughed. He had good reason to laugh. His serving day had jollof and chicken.

True balance was restored. The world did not end that day after all. I wolfed down the gɔbɛ before anyone could come and cause me any more distress.

Once bitten, twice shy.

As the mid-term break approached, there was the issue of another monthly test. They were still as detestable as ever.

“All pens and pencils down. Make sure you have your name and class on the answer sheet. Pass all answer sheets forward. Hey! Hey! Shishta, I said stop work!”

Mr. Pechie was a core math teacher, and that day he was our invigilator. He called all the girls ‘sister’, except it came out as ‘shishta’. There’s a lot to be said about the great Mr. Pechie, but let’s leave that for another day.

“You”, Mr. Pechie pointed at me, “collect them for me.”

I wish I paid more attention to in class or at least, spent more time studying the night before. The Core Math test had ten questions. Just ten, all of them circle theorem questions.

I could almost hear questions two, seven and eight mocking me as they rocked me.

Today, however, was a day of celebration. It was the start of the mid-term break!

There was an elephant in the room, however: Ama wouldn’t be going home. After falling on the Atico list, she would have to stay in school throughout the mid-term break and study and work.

That term we had hope, or so we thought. Founders’ day had gone really well. A lot of the form three students said it was the best they had seen. In the past, the headmistress was known to cancel Atico after a good Founders’ Day performance. This was Ama’s only hope.

During the headmistress’s announcements after Founders’ Day, we were praying gidigidi that she would cancel Atico that term and let us all go home.

It didn’t happen.

The tests were finally over! It was time to get our butts outta the prison yard… errr, schoolyard 😇.

I’m not sure why, but the arts students finished their papers a short while before us, and were already on their way out of the form 1 block. I saw Akua walking with her friends and ran to catch up with her.

“Akua.”

She turned and smiled. “Kodzoooo!” Oh those dimples. 😍

“Ermmm, c-c-can I have your number again?” I asked. You should understand, I was stil just a little nervous around her. There was instant perspiration, and it must have been nothing short of hilarious because she couldn’t stop giggling.

“Hmmm, I don’t know”, she teased, “you kind of botched things up the last time.”

“Oh, I never told you? I called an old guy picked and my English finished when I heard the voice so I chickened out.”

The explanation sounded much better in my head.

“Oh, my daddy scared you? He’s a real softy.” she replied.

I wasn’t convinced. “I don’t know, he sounded kinda buff to me.”

“And how exactly do buff people sound?” she asked.

“Ummm, like this.” I said, doing my huskiest vocal impression.

She laughed again. “Silly. Do you have a piece of paper?”

You could see the confusion on my face. It screamed, “What is paper?”

All I had in my bag was my inordinately huge ‘Aki-Ola Core Math’ textbook. I was trying to take it out and rip out a page when she sighed. “Don’t worry. Bring your palm.”

She scribbled her number with much effort into my now-sweaty palm.

“Someone picking you up or you’re going by yourself?” she asked, as she put the cap back on her pen. “Abi you deɛ, you’re a hard guy.”

“Hard guy”, I laughed, “I’ll pick a trotro at the station.”

I noticed Ama looking back at us up ahead.

“Ermm, it looks like Ama’s waiting for you. She hasn’t forgiven me yet, has she?”

Akua shrugged it off. “She’s just a little fragile now, that’s all. I hope you call or text this time. I’ll be waiting”, she said, walking backwards towards Ama as the bell rang for dining on the East.

It turns out Ama cried a lot that day as her friends left for home and she had to stay back on Atico. From what I hear, Akua promised to bring her gɔbɛ and sobolo when coming back before she calmed down. Yes, Ama too is a goblin. 😄

A part of me believes that sweaty palms are the work of the devil.

The sweat was mixing with the ink, diluting the phone number from right off my palm. I frantically searched for a pen, which should be a lot easier to do when you just finished an exam. When I found one, I transferred the number to my Aki-Ola Core Math book.

I really couldn’t tell if the last number was a seven or a four, but not to worry, I went home and called both numbers that night.

The first number turned out to belong to some old lady: let’s forget that ever happened. The point is, I called Akua.

How did the conversation go? How long did we talk for? Seriously, that’s not the focus of this story. But I did better this time.

Returning to school after a mid-term break is hard. It’s not as hard as returning after a full vacation break, but it’s hard nonetheless. Just as you begin to feel like this dream of living a life not governed by a bell has come to stay… Boom! It’s Monday and you’re ironing your uniform to come back to school.

But at least, you get to come back with home chow and more provisions to add weight to your very light chop box.

That evening, the dining hall was alive with chatter. It was always like that after every mid-term break. It turned out the school administration had allowed the Aticans (that’s what we called victims of Atico) to go home on the third day, so they had half a mid-term break. That was a first; we must have really impressed them during the Founders’ Day.

On table C19 everyone had fresh haircuts. That’s usually a good thing, but not always.

You see, not all heads are understood by all barbers. There is a fundamental need for a man to remain loyal to his barber. Listen, and learn wisdom: Never cheat on your barber. Ever.

Now, that the foundation is set, let us meet our juggernaut…

If you’re a fan of Marvel Comics or their movies you’ve probably come across The Juggernaut before, a powerful unstoppable mutant who charges at everything like a wrecking ball with his rock-solid head and tough body. KQ was about to attain juggernaut status that day.

“Who is KQ?” you ask. I will tell you.

KQ was a really smart Aggrey boy. He was also on table C19, and he had a head.

Now I know what you’re saying, “Everybody has a head, are you crazy?”

Listen to me, I know what I’m talking about: KQ had a head.

Remember I said KQ was smart? Some of us believe it was because his brain was… ermm… well-ventilated? Like, his head was so uniquely shaped, you couldn’t forge it.

I’m sure a lot of you are wondering, “Kodzo, why are you being so mean?” You obviously haven’t met KQ. That guy was merciless in his mockery. Merciless, I tell you. Fortunately for him, he could laugh at himself as well, so he was quite a good sport whenever he was the butt of a joke.

That night, KQ entered the dining hall late. What a mistake.

Onero spotted him first. “Yooooo, KQ drop.”

Everybody looked up and began to let out stifled laughter. KQ had obviously cheated on his barber: his haircut was very low, almost to his skin.

Fades were considered non-school, and as we later found out, the new barber had given him a fade, and then to correct the mistake, he had to thin out the rest of his hair, which resulted in an accentuation of his unique head shape.

KQ tried to blow off the laughter with a fake I’ve-got-it-all-figured-out vibe.

“Ah, you guys, e be my haircut? Small attention adey search wey you play into my trap like that”, he said confidently.

“Oh you dey lie”, Jona laughed, “your barber mafia you.”

The banter went back and forth for a while, then things settled.

All the while, one person was quiet: Capone. Capone (or Capeezy) was this usually quiet guy that KQ constantly picked on for little things like grammatical errors. He seemed deep in thought.

KQ should have left him alone that evening.

“Capeezy, why, your woman leave you?” he prodded.

The reply seemed almost rehearsed, “Nah, I was just wondering what your skull looks like.”

You should have seen the shock on the young man’s face. I mean, we all have a general idea of how to draw a skull, right? That day we realized a very deep truth, that drawing a skull and drawing KQ’s skull are two totally different things. I think even KQ will admit this.

I laughed so hard I got dizzy. Talk about a clapback.

The rest of the evening dining was pretty uneventful, just a lot of mid-term gossip, nothing particularly useful. This, however, was not the last we would hear of KQ that evening.

Common room meetings after reopening or returning from mid-term breaks were always a bore. Smizzle would go ooooooon and ooooooon, usually about something to do with money. In his own words, he could “smell money”. He also ended every sentence with “Are you okay? Mmm?” which effectively made his speeches twice as long as they had to be.

This was the cause of KQ’s new problem: sleep.

Rumour has it that the main reason Smizzle had been made Aggrey housemaster was because about two years earlier he had solved a water problem in his former house, Gyamfi House, and Aggrey had a very similar water problem.

As Smizzle outlined his master plan to dig a big ol‘ water reservoir — which for about a year became an AirBnB for mosquitoes — consistently interjecting with his trademark “Are you okay? Mmm?”, KQ began to feel sleepy.

It was Banana who drew my attention to KQ as he began to nod off. He tapped me lightly so Smizzle wouldn’t see.

“Shhhhh.” He put his finger to his lips and pointed at KQ.

According to the laws of physics, when a body’s centre of gravity is displaced outside of its base, it becomes unstable and topples over in an attempt to restore stability. If truly, KQ’s centre of mass was his head, and I think Capeezy would argue for this motion, then his centre of gravity was definitely higher up his body, and with the simple harmonic motion of dozing and nodding off, it was only a matter of time before…

I saw it in slow motion. The head went first. The body followed. Nobody could stop gravity at this point. To the heroes who think I should have caught the head, or whatever other insane suggestion your imagination is giving you, understand this:

Nothing can stop the Juggernaut!

When the Juggernaut meets an obstacle, he does not go around it, he goes through it. If I attempted to stop that head that day, I probably wouldn’t be able to play the guitar today.

Do I feel guilty? Maybe if it was someone else, but I knew the juggernaut would be fine.

As the head collided with the ground, BOOOOOOOOM!!!We felt shock-waves. In the words of Kari Jobe in her song titled ‘Forever’, “🎵The ground began to shake…🎵“. (It helps if you know the song.)

Okay, I’m kidding, but there was certainly an impressive thud.

Was KQ hurt? Nope. I kid you not, he merely woke up.

Smizzle however, in fact, the whole common room besides me and Banana, was startled. Everyone grew quiet and watched as KQ stood up, shook his magnificent head and sat down again, wide awake this time.

I couldn’t contain my laughter when Smizzle asked with genuine concern, not as filler speech, “Are you okay? Mmm?”

Of course, KQ was okay, it was the common room floor that had cause to complain. Remember…

Nothing can stop the Juggernaut!

Don’t take life too seriously.

Sports was always a confusing topic in Motown. Sometimes it was loved, and sometimes it was hated. Don’t get me wrong, the students absolutely loved it — the confusion was with the school administration.

Some days, our sportsmen and sportswomen were heroes, flying the Motown flag high, but on other days they were considered scum of the earth, muscle-bound jocks who did nothing but run really fast, throw stuff around, and kick footballs on a field. It was rare to find a student who was both brain and brawn.

This is where I come in…

Okay, that’s a lie. I was as skinny as they come.

In fact, sports felt like a chore to me. I mean, I’m good with a basketball, but only on account of my height. That’s it.

I have no other unique value proposition to offer a sports team.

I’m digressing though, let’s talk about athletics.

Athletics in Motown is one of those events that can bond a whole house.

I guess for a significant number of us it was just the idea of having a half-day that excited us. For the many who discovered their thirst for gambling early, it was “Motown Betting Season”. Unknown to many, there was actually quite a bit of race-fixing that went on.

The inter-house love stories that brewed in these moments were priceless and the jama was lit!

As I’ve mentione before, jama was often “carefully disguised profanity”, but it would surprise you to know that during athletics you could sometimes find Aggrey boys and MacCarthy girls singing love songs to each other as part of the jama.

Now that I’ve written it, it sounds lame. But it happened. More than once.

I’m not talking about some boy and some girl alone in one corner singing oo. If that were the case, there would be a lot more happening, but definitely nothing musical.

I mean the entire house singing and cheering their girls or boys on.

In moments like this Akua, and any other non-MacCarthy girl, was the enemy, and all MacCarthy girls were bae. Yes, you read that right.

But putting all that aside, you should have seen the way the sportsmen killed themselves. I remember General Bombo almost died after attempting the 3000m marathon. The dude couldn’t walk for like three days.

I know this because I was one of the unfortunate juniors who had to carry him back to Aggrey House. He didn’t win too oo.

Another guy, they called him Obstinate — an apt name indeed — tried the high jump, missed the mattress and went unconscious for a full five minutes. If it had been KQ, the Juggernaut, the ground would have apologized.

Needless to say, Obstinate didn’t win the high jump either.

I hope you can see the passion with which they attacked these sports, because that is the basis of the story I am about to tell you, at least, as it was told to me.

Prof Akilakpah Sawyer, the Motown Akilakpah, not the original one, had a saying he loved, “While the white man is exploiting the moon, the black man is dancing in the moonlight.”

Today, people will call that racist. Back then, we didn’t care. Besides, Prof is as black as they come.

Okay, to be honest, I had a problem with the statement myself, until one day there was a power outage, ‘dumsor‘, and under the light of the full moon, I watched bored black men ‘shii jama‘ and dance in the moonlight. Talk about mixed feelings.

It was during one such blackout that we heard the story of the 2005 Motown Basketball Team. An embodiment of passion — and disregard for authority — but still, passion.

One senior, Ɛkpɛ — it means ‘stone’ in Ewe — told us this story, which served as motivation both to pursue passion and defy authority: a dangerous combination.

I will now enter the ‘Avatar State’ and let a member of the team tell you the story himself.

You’ll need your imagination for this one.

My name is Kofi. I was in Motown from 2003 till 2006 — Livingstone House.

The year was 2005. Kuffuor was president of Ghana, and Bush was president of America. The names Bin Laden and Sadam Hussein were popular on the news. Terms like ‘toxic masculinity’ and the ‘Cancel Culture’ were yet to be invented… or popularized if they were even a thing. Whatsapp? Facebook? Twitter? Instagram? iPhone? Never heard of ’em. Life was simpler.

As for me, everyday was another day to play basketball. Ball was life! And without exaggeration, I’m pretty sure I was the first person to come up with the term, “All my guys are ballers”.

The Sprite Ball Championship is the biggest high school basketball tournament in Ghana. I don’t know if it’s as big today as it was back then, but chale. Ah, wait, was it even called Sprite Ball then? I don’t remember, and I doubt it was. I can’t even remember how much the cash prize was. But this won’t spoil my story. Take the details I share with a grain of salt.

So Sprite Ball was approaching, and my guys and I were training gidigidi. Come and see lay-ups, three-pointers and dunking — virtually everyday on the Yorks City court behind Lugard house.

We were on fire!!!

So you can imagine our surprise when Mrs. Konu, the head of physical education called us a week to the competition and told us, “Ermmm, the headmistress says you are not going for the Sprite Ball. We need you to focus and study for your SSSCE.”

“Ei, who does she think she is?!” someone half-shouted. “E be she, she go play?” another asked, obviously annoyed. The ruckus that errupted was anything but pretty. All this time, however, PY, our captain, was absolutely quiet. You could literally see in his face that wheels were turning.

And then he spoke, “Okay, Mrs Konu, we won’t play. We’ll use the time to study.”

Whaaaaat?! “Who are you, and what have you done with PY?” I thought. And then I saw the wink. Very quick, and very subtle, but a wink nonetheless. The boys saw it too. We all quieted down and allowed Mrs. Konu to think we had given up.

By 4:30am the next morning we were back on the Yorks City court shooting hoops, and Mrs Konu was none the wiser.

I can’t tell you all the times we almost got caught, or all the times we lied through our teeth. Just know that getting to the competition cost us a lot of integrity and 300,000 cedis — old cedis, that is. It translates to just 30 cedis today, cheap lunch for a week, but we were broke students, and inflation rates then were not what they are now. That money was a fortune to us, chale. But we made it.

Finally, the day was upon us. We woke up giddy with excitement. It was the start of the two-day tournament. The plan was simple; break bounds, win our matches, come back, and do it again tomorrow. Simple huh?

The tournament was slated to start at 10am.

By 5am, clad in black t-shirts so we could blend into the early morning darkness all team members slipped out of their houses, and we were on our way to the Aviation Social Centre for the competition.

As soon as we arrived, we realised our first mistake: we had no jerseys.

Of course, how do you get school jerseys when your school has no idea you’re competing on their behalf. Did we feel silly? Of course. Did that stop us? Heck no.

We bought chalk, white chalk, and numbered our black t-shirts. Problem solved.

We had two games that day to secure a position in the semi-finals the next day. For the purposes of avoiding inaccuracy and keeping this short, I cannot mention the teams we faced, but all I can say is that we made the mistake of whooping their butts too hard. By the time we got back to the school later that evening rumours were already everywhere that we had hopelessly smoked the competition.

Mrs Konu would definitely be looking for us the next day. I guess there is such a thing as over-performing.

What do you do when you know you’re in trouble for starting something you haven’t finished? I don’t know about you, but for us, we finish what we start. The next day at 5am, before any teachers could come looking for us, once more clad in black t-shirts, and this time with fresh chalk, we snuck out of our houses and made our way to the Aviation Social Centre.

There’s a certain viciousness you play with when you know that you’ll be going back to be punished. It’s like an extra incentive to get the job done, so you can say, “At least we won”.

If you’re one of those kids who would play football on the streets and have to wash your feet to make sure your parents didn’t find out — which they always did — then you know the passion with which you played, and you can relate.

See, no team could stand in our way that day. The semi-finals were a total breeze; we completely destroyed whatever school that was. All I remember is that their jerseys were blue, and they cried like little girls afterwards.

As we relaxed and got ready for the final match, we noticed the weirdest thing; familiar faces in the crowd. The spread of rumours back then was an active effort. There was no one to tweet our victories, so the presence of students and teachers alike at the game meant that people were receiving updates via text and calls, and students were actually breaking bounds to watch the game.

So on the one hand, there were teachers waiting to carry us back to the school’s disciplinary committee, and on the other, there were students, with mobile phones, by inference, who skipped class and broke bounds to watch our game. This was all the home support we had. It was going to have to do.

I honestly cannot remember who we played in the final — I think they wore green — but those guys were good.

From the first jump ball, and for the first time in the tournament, someone jumped higher than me. They went against us point for point, rebound for rebound, lay-up for lay-up. I don’t know, maybe they also broke bounds to come and play. Seriously though, that match was one of the toughest games of my life.

Finally, with 15 seconds left on the clock — which is an eternity in a basketball game — PY called for a time-out. This was the last play of the game. They were ahead of us by a single point.

“Boys”, he began, “I didn’t lie to Mrs Konu and break bounds to take second place. Make this last play count! Kwame, steal the ball and pass to Danny. Danny, I want you to shoot a fake three which will be a decoy alley for Kofi. They will be afraid to foul you and give us a free throw. Kofi, I want you to dunk that alley-“

“Huh?!” I interjected, “You want me to what?! The last time I tried an alley I almost broke my wrist. You want me to be the one who failed the team? Why don’t you do it?”

“Bro, I believe in you”, he replied, “Plus the alley will catch them off guard and ensure there’s no time for a counter play.”

This boy thought we were acting a movie or something, throwing cheesy lines like that around. The problem is, when the captain believes in you, everyone believes in you. I was going to have to finish it. We broke up our huddle and prepared for our last play. Everyone was nervous.

I felt I would piss my pants.

It took a full four seconds for Kwame to steal the ball. Another three to get it to Danny.

One quick glance at me, one quick glance at the rim, and the fake three was in the air.

I panicked. I ran. I jumped.

Too early. I barely connected with the ball.

Was I about to dunk with just my finger tips?

It was going in… it was going in… the crowd held their breath…

Fat chance. The ball slipped off my fingers as I dropped out of the air… it bounced on the inner rim, then unto the outer rim… and began to roll off the rim!!!

I was dead. I’d messed up the alley hoop. Two days of breaking bounds for nothing.

As I landed I caught a glimpse of a flash of black dash past me and take off into the air.

My good friend, I was witnessing the greatest rebound in Motown basketball history, as PY caught the ball in mid-air and drove it into net, executing a slam dunk that would make Lebron squeal.

The crowd went silent in disbelief… and then when we realized what had just happened we let out a thunderous roar!

We won! We actually won!

For the first (and last) time in history, the teachers and the bound-breakers rushed unto the court and joined hands to lift us up in celebration. It took the teachers a while to realize they had made a mistake in celebrating with us. We were no longer a bunch of truant hooligans. We were basketball heroes.

We had won the tournament by a single point.

Let us now exit the ‘Avatar State’…

[Kodzo here]

“Ah, Ɛkpɛ, you sure say this thing happen?” I asked with skepticism.

“Oh yeah”, he replied.

The lights suddenly came on. Power had been restored; our little ‘By the Fireside’ would be broken up soon.

“If you figa adey lie”, Ɛkpɛ said as he stood up to leave, “check the best sportsmen’s list at the administration block. Look for a name with the initials ‘PY’ around 2006.”

So… did this story actually happen? Pick a car to Motown, ask for the administration block, and check the sportsmen’s list yourself.

I can’t be answering all your questions.

I honestly don’t know any school apart from Motown that has room on their calendar for an inter-house gardening competition. I mean, honestly, flowers? Oh well. it simply meant more work for us.

As you may remember, the state of water issues in Aggrey House was deplorable, and by extension, floral life was pretty much non-existent. At least, not the kind of pretty flowers and plants you would actually like to see.

All work was supervised by the bellboys. In the beginning, there was Sweet Sugar and Obstinate. Towards the end, we had Jay-Dark, Salageezy, and Atta-Kay.

Honestly, I missed Sweet Sugar and Obstinate.

These slave drivers had us fetching water to pour on the bare soil. Like, yo! You didn’t plant anything. What are you watering?

Every day, after lunch, you could find Aggrey boys moving between Aggrey House and the dining hall in their red shirts, with yellow Kuffuor gallons.

If this sounds like annoying work, you are right, and that is why Obodai and I tried to play smart and dodge the water-fetching.

We were caught.

“So you people be sly ehnn?!” Jay Dark bellowed.

The question was rhetorical. Only a fool would answer.

We were fools. “Oh, no be so-“.

“SHUT-UP!!” came the reply.

Why was he shouting? Seriously, this guy was always shouting. Didn’t he know how to have a quiet conversation?

“You figure say you be smart aaaama”, he smirked, “rydee see you.”

See us oo. We were kneeling down at A-Court, the corridor leading from the main entrance to the staircase, while Jay Dark looked down on us from the staircase.

“You know your punishment?” he asked.

“Do I look like a psychic to you?” I replied. (In my head).

In case you were wondering, kneeling down is not a punishment. It’s like ‘counter-back’ cells before Nsawam, or hell before the lake of fire… but that’s just by the way.

“You people dey come ‘save’ the Aggrey garden”, he answered himself with a smile.

That didn’t sound good.

“From here, the two of you go fetch twenty buckets of manure — EACH — from the piggery to the lawns.”

Ah, wait, did this guy just say we were going to carry pig poop?

Surprise surprise, Motown has a piggery. They actually raise pigs in that school… and you’d be surprised just how much poop they generate.

But seriously, twenty buckets of pig poop?! Obodai tried to object, but just then Eben, the house prefect, passed by, so his words got stuck in his throat. He would much rather take his chances with the pigs than junior Hitler.

I should probably spare you the details of how we used pieces of plywood to shove the poop into condemned buckets, and how the flies followed us as we carried the dense heavy poop from the piggery, past not one, not two, but three girls’ houses, and back to Aggrey house. Or how the poop splattered as we dumped it on the lawn, and we had to dodge for dear life to make sure we could still wear our shirts afterwards.

Needless to say, we couldn’t do twenty buckets. You probably have no idea how much pig poop weighs. No friggin’ idea.

The most painful part was when we realized Jay Dark wasn’t even counting. I don’t blame him. Who wants to sit around and count piles of doody?

After the third trip — six buckets each — we grabbed some sticks, spread the poop around, and called it a day.

Five showers later (I’m kidding. We had no water. Did we even shower?) we were in class for prep. We slept throughout. We had literally done a sh*t-load of work and it showed. We were hopelessly worn out.

This was two weeks before the gardening competition.

I think it’s safe to say our bellboy had a lot of crappy ideas. You can’t dump poop on a lawn and expect flowers to grow all of a sudden. Somehow, he wasn’t perturbed.

After Obodai and me, many more Aggrey form one boys fell prey to the ‘crap trap’.

It wasn’t even funny.

We were carrying crap, shovelling sh*t, piling poop, dumping doody, and the lawns were not getting any prettier. As a matter of fact, the house began to smell. Duh.

Smizzle couldn’t stand it. Due to his height, or lack thereof, he seemed to have to contend a little more directly with the stench as he walked past the lawns.

That’s what’s happens when you’re too down to earth. 😅

Anyway, he figured the solution was to dilute the crap.

He was wrong.

After picking up our Kuffuor gallons and making a gazillion trips to the dining hall to water the lawns, the scent of pig poop quickly became the scent of wet pig poop.

If you’re ever forced to choose between regular pig poop and wet pig poop, choose regular pig poop.

Wet pig poop is worse. Much worse.

To every cloud, there is a silver lining. This was our silver lining, weeds managed to grow in place of grass over the next two weeks. Considering that our lawns were full of sand just weeks before, this was actually a step up, believe it or not.

We pulled out the old lawnmower, which hadn’t been used in the two terms I’d been in Motown, and we mowed the weeds evenly. From afar, it created the illusion of a nice bed of grass. At close range, the scent and sight would make your eyes water.

We weren’t going down without a fight though.

On the morning of the competition, we painted our empty flower pots and pulled out our biology textbooks to scientifically label every plant and weed that dared grow in our poop garden, as if we had planted anything on purpose. Looking back, we were as hopeless as Ole’s Manchester United.

Needless to say, we lost the gardening competition.

I can’t say I cared much, but I did learn some valuable lessons.

Firstly, don’t dodge work. Seriously, don’t.

Secondly, with all the agriculture taught in Ghanaian high schools, don’t take pig poop to an NPK 15:15:15 fight.

“🎶Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna in high-igh-eeeeeeeest!🎶“

The praises session in the Aggrey chapel that day was craaaaazy.

It was Palm Sunday, the day Jesus sat on a donkey to enter Jerusalem so that He could die for all of us.

I didn’t care.

That was not the reason for my excitement. Oh Lord, I’m sorry.

t was the last Sunday of the term! I could smell the freedom of vacation drawing near.

There were palm branches tied to the pillars of the chapel—probably put there to remind people like me of the importance of what we were commemorating.

Some of the girls actually found the time to weave palm fronds into elaborate patterns like we used to when we were kids.

Truth be told, the way my mind was hot for exams, I’d forgotten all about Palm Sunday till I got to the chapel and saw the branches tied to the pillars.

But what was so special about that day? I mean, besides Jesus’ triumphant entry. Two words: Core Mathematics.

Hol’ up. Easy with the nerd jokes.

You remember how I said I scored straight A’s the term before? (Not helping my nerd case much, am I?)

Well, do you also remember how I messed up when Akua told me her friend, Ama, had dropped Atico?

You’ve put two and two together, haven’t you?

Yes, I was going to be teaching Akua—and Ama—Core Maths that morning at prep. Akua had been trying to help Ama, but after two very arduous monthly tests she had to call backup: me. 😎

It was an opportunity to redeem myself. If she passed, I would be a hero. If she didn’t, well, I would have tried.

My real problem, however, was that they had waited so long to ask for help. The Core Math paper was slated for Wednesday; the last but one paper for the term before the Easter break. Since they were on the West and I was on the East, Sunday prep was really the only time we could study together.

Just two hours out of the whole week! We would need a miracle.

As soon as the closing prayer was over I rushed from the Aggrey Chapel to Science 4. No way I was going to blow this date.

Wait, did I say ‘date’? 😅

Lesson… I meant lesson.

I was the first person in the classroom.

I took my humongous Aki-Ola Core Mathematics textbook out of my bag and waited.

The classroom began to fill up. Two minutes, no Akua. Five minutes, no Akua. Ei.

Ten minutes later I had almost lost hope.

Maybe they changed their minds… wait… was that…? Yes! A familiar face poked itself through the door of Science 4 and looked around.

She was like a ray of Heaven’s light piercing through dark clouds. I could hear R. Kelly’s “Storm is Over” playing in my mind, chale. I waved enthusiastically at Akua. She saw me and smiled. Then she beckoned to Ama who was standing behind her, held her by the shoulders and gave her a quick inaudible fifteen-second pep talk. Then she waved at me again, showing of those dimples 😍… and walked off. 😲

Ah! What? Why? When did the plan change? What was going on?

Ama entered the class and made a beeline for my desk. My quizzical look met her indifferent look, and the awkwardness began.

“Hi”, she said, extending a folded piece of paper to me. “‘Bitha said to give you this.”

“Oh, okay”, I responded, still confused as I took the note and she planted herself behind the desk next to me.

I unfolded the note, desperately looking for answers to why my quality time with Akua was taking this turn. The note read:

    Hey Kodzo,

    I noe I was supposed 2 join u guys 2 study, but as it stands now Ama z de 1 hu rly needs de help. I think I’ll be fyn, and i didn’t wanna b a distrxn. I’m sure u understand.

    I’ve asked her to be nice. I owe you one.

Tnx again,

Akua

As usual, ignore the unnecessary shorthand.

I wasn’t sure how to react. This was not what I signed up for.

Could I ditch Ama? Only if I never wanted Akua to look in my direction again.

I didn’t know whether to feel played or important. On the one hand, my date, sorry, lesson plans had been altered. On the other hand, Akua had entrusted me with one of her best friends.

Every sensible guy knows that a girl’s closest friends are “members of the board”. If they don’t like you, you may win a few battles but you’ll lose the war. I was going to have to score math points with Ama.

I folded up the note and tucked it into the breast pocket of my jumper.

“So, where and where do you need help?”

Herh!!!! Like Heeerrrrhhh!!!! You don’t know how annoying this answer is until you’re trying to teach someone and they say this. Herh!!!

I wanted to drop-kick the girl, lah. What do you mean ‘the whole show’?

“What do you mean ‘the whole show’?” my mouth echoed my thoughts.

“I mean, I just don’t get…” her words trailed off and she began to cry. Like… ah!

Great. Just great. Now I had a crying child on my hands.

I did not plan for this. I was not trained for this.

I hate to see a lady cry. It’s heart-wrenching. “Please stop crying”, I begged her.

It was only a matter of time before my classmates would notice things getting weird.

“Pleeeeeease”, I begged her.

She sniffled and wiped her face. Man was hot.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to make a scene. You don’t have to help if you don’t want to”, she said, “a lot of people have tried. I didn’t mean to weird you out.” Her eyes were still red from the brief waterworks.

I was in a tight corner. Things weren’t supposed to get emotional.

“I think I have an idea…”

The last paper was over. Science 4 was emptying out, and I was packing my stuff, getting ready to head to the chapel for the term’s closing assembly. The last paper had been Social Studies. I was still trying to comprehend how the paper had rocked me.

I mean… how? Social Studies; a simple home sense course like that.

Did I study? No… it was Social Studies; it was supposed to be easy. Why did it rock me? Wh-

“So, how did you do it?”

The question broke my train of thought.

“Huh?” I looked up.

I was surprised to see one of Akua’s friends. They called her Emefa. Typical cute Ewe girl. Made-in-Ghana Ayigbe toffee, with body too for good measure.

Such a dangerous combination.😂

“Do what?” I asked.

“Ama, she’s… ermm… she’s glowing”, she answered with a chuckle, “can’t seem to stop smiling since the Core Math paper”.

“Ooooh, Ama”, I responded. I’d forgotten about her. The paper rocked me that bad. “I don’t think I did much oo. We just solved the monthly test questions again and identified her weak spots. Then she spent an hour or so a day working on those topics before-“

“Kodzooooo!” Another interruption.

This wasn’t Akua’s voice. It was Ama. I hadn’t seen her enter the class.

She rushed at me and wrapped me in a bear hug. Okay, she wasn’t really big, so more like a teddy bear hug, or maybe a koala bear hug ‘cos she didn’t want to let go🤔… I don’t know, I’m still thinking this through.😂

“The paper was jeeeerh!” she half shouted. (Oh, SHS lingo🤦)

“Take it easy”, I laughed. She didn’t take it easy. She went on and on and on, especially about how one question wanted to trick her, but she saw the trick and “tricked the trick”.

Obviously she hadn’t had a problem with Social Studies like me. It wasn’t her fault; Arts 4 did History, Government and Economics, so Social Studies was their bread and butter.

Come and see me. I had to swallow my Social Studies pain and celebrate with them.

As Ama continued to ramble on, all while still holding on to me (see? Koala bear), I saw Akua enter science 4.

I flashed her a look that said: “Save me”.

“Alright, alright, ladies, let the young man breathe”, she laughed, as she helped Emefa rescue me from Ama’s grip. The satisfied look on their faces showed that I had scored major points with the members of the board. I already had Nhyie in my corner from Val’s Day.

Social Studies aside, it was a good day.

As we walked to the Aggrey Chapel, already late, myself and three Baeta girls, we drew stares from those who were already seated.

As we scampered on my eyes happened to lock with Gbewee, my school father. He had a look of pleasant surprise on his face as he mouthed the words, “my boy”.

In the Aggrey Chapel, students sit in classes. My three seconds of pride from strolling with these fine girls evaporated as the chaplain bellowed into the microphone, “Will those latecomers hurry up and sit down?!”

Oh we flew to our seats.

In case I never told you, we had four chaplains in Motown. This was the head chaplain, Rev B. She was not the kind of person you wanted to annoy. “Bow down your heads in shame and ask for forgiveness!” she commanded everyone.

And that’s how we ended the term before the Easter break; repenting under the leadership of Rev B.

Of course, some saw it as an opportunity to sleep. Not Obodai.

He scooted over and whispered, “Bro, Emefa, wossop? My eye dey inside.”

I had a feeling this wouldn’t end well… 

The third term began with a lot of changes. A lot.

It all started when we arrived on Sunday. As usual, Smizzle, Eben, and the assistant house prefect, Elorm, sat outside the house behind a big table with their notebooks open.

After two terms, I was used to this scene. Today, however, something was different.

Heaped, so out of place, on the floor next to the table was a pile of khaki trousers.

It hit me like a blow to the gut: 20cm! I had completely forgotten!

Anyone who has attended Motown within the last decade knows what 20cm represents; and it’s something that leaves everybody asking the same question, “Why?”

Beginning from the third term of that year, a new rule took effect: the bottom cuff/ bottom hem (whatever it’s really called) of every boy’s trousers was supposed to be a minimum of 20cm wide. Anything less and the trousers would be confiscated.

No, it’s not a joke, it’s an actual thing. Ask anyone.

I told you you’d ask “Why?”

Well, short answer, skinnies were in fashion, and fashionable is almost always non-school. If you keep asking why I might never end this paragraph. The school rules simply hated fashionable. Heck, almost everyone who ever won the SRC award for ‘Most Fashionable’ had some sort of rap sheet with the school’s disciplinary committee over non-school clothes.

Looking fly and being law-abiding were like oil and water: they didn’t mix.

But chale, boys refused to hear. They would get their clothes seized and proudly walk back to their dorms in their ‘creamy’ tɛgɛɛ singlets because the title of ‘Most Fa’ was to die for. As if they would put it on their resumes or something.

Anyway, back to the table in front of Aggrey House.

“Ametewee, your father is not with you?”, Smizzle grunted.

“No sir.”

“Where are your house dues?”

This man. Straight to the money matters. At least, pretend to be concerned about my well-being mpo eh.

Daddy had learned by now that Smizzle could smell money He dropped me off in front of Aggrey House like Snoop Dogg dropped whatever hot thing that song was about, and sped off.

I understood him. We both knew Smizzle could invent expenses to add to the house dues when he saw parents. For the first time, I was facing Smizzle on my own.

As soon as I finished counting out the money, Elorm, the assistant house prefect had me open my trunk and went straight to the business of meticulously measuring my trouser cuffs with his unnecessarily long ruler in hopes of confiscating them. The length of his ruler baffled me. I mean, you need exactly 20cm of a ruler to measure 20cm of a trouser cuff. Ah well.

He seemed genuinely disappointed when none of my three pairs of trousers met the criteria for confiscation.

I have previously painted a really mean picture of Eben, and while he certainly was a blood-relative of the Grinch, I have done him a disservice: Elorm was worse.

There were days he would get me, but not in this trouser war. Even though I’d forgotten the 20cm rule, I had a superpower: I was a ‘jon’ boy. Nobody was gonna take me down for looking too good!

“Take your stuff upstairs”, he commanded. As if I wasn’t going to take them up anyway.

Obodai was less fortunate. Missing the mark by a measly 5mm, he had his newly ‘pimped’ trousers seized by a very satisfied Elorm. The poor boy would have to wear one of my trousers until the next visiting day when his parents could bring him another pair.

I was at least six inches taller than Obodai. When he put my trousers on, you couldn’t tell whether he wore the trousers or the trousers wore him. 😂

Pythagoras’ Theorem says… on second thought you already know what it says, or you don’t care. At the very least you should remember that it has something to do with the sides of right-angled triangles.

Apaa Dede was the barber on the western compound. If Apaa Dede touched your head, we could use your hairline to teach Pythagoras’ Theorem. I don’t know how or why, but once you were sent to Apaa Dede for having bushy hair you would come back with a hairline at some odd angle.

There are three schools of thought:

    1. Apaa Dede didn’t have steady hands.

    2. He actually thought he was being stylish. Or…

    3. He was paid extra by the school to ensure that his victims regretted coming to school with bushy hair.

My money’s on 3.

During the course of that first week, it was common to see his victims pass by every now and then.

Oh, the hairlines I saw; angled and sinusoidal. The worst part was these people actually paid money for these haircuts! High school really teaches you that life is not fair. 😅

Another change happened in the D-Hall that week. This was actually a change that was proposed to us, which we foolishly accepted.

Back in my early years in Motown, our dining hall boasted of something only private schools had on their breakfast tables: chocolate spread.

Depending on whether or not you are a dadaba, you might be thinking at this point, “Wow! Chocolate spread?!” or “Oh. Just chocolate spread?” Either way, there was chocolate spread… and margarine, and groundnut paste. In a school where you’re not allowed to skip dining, or bring your own food into the dining hall, our breakfasts were not dry, and we loved it.

However, some people felt that the money spent on these extras would serve better use in increasing the quantity of rice in our meals.

Also, two of the five bolus slots on the d-hall menu would give way to yam with kontomire stew and another slot for gɔbɛ. If you know me, you know I welcomed another gɔbɛ slot wholeheartedly.

(It was the chocolate spread and margarine going away that was a bad call. Less than a month later, the rice levels would dwindle back to normal, and we would be left with neither chocolate spread nor extra rice. No wonder so many politicians attended Motown. We were hoodwinked… easy koraa.) 😂

The last major change was the announced appointment of new prefects. In Motown, only senior prefects are voted for. Everyone else is appointed.

Since there was no WASSCE exam in 2010, on account of the move from a three-year to a four-year high school system, there would be no new election.

The few prefects who wanted to step down were free to do so, and whatever changes were made by the school administration were implemented.

I didn’t do as well in the second term as I did in the first. It was the start of my rather unfortunate decline.

Although I would never be a below-average student, as the lines were drawn between the various kinds of sea creatures, I would soon leave the realm of the sharks. If there was ever a group of students known as dolphins, I would find myself in those ranks for a few years. Better than being a goldfish though.

After our meeting with Azotobacter, our form master, to review our performance from the previous term, we had our first lesson, and school was in full swing.

The only obvious difference was the empty seats of the students on internal suspension for reporting to school late. The poor children were out in the bush chopping down trees like Paul Bunyan.

(If you were reading ‘Snake Girl’ in primary school, I won’t blame you for not knowing who Paul Bunyan is.)

Very soon the bell rang for the snack break. I spent about ten minutes finishing an assignment, and then I legged it upstairs to see Akua — I’d missed those dimples, chale.😍

Akua was not there. Weird. Ama wasn’t there either, and she was the only one I’d care to ask of Akua’s whereabouts.

Considering I’d lost a significant chunk of my snack break already, I headed over to the snack square. The term was still young, she’d surely turn up.

I bought a bottle of coke and four sausage rolls — because everyone is rich during the first week of school — then I moved to a bench in one corner of the snack square and sat down to eat.

I bowed my head, said a quick prayer, and raised my head only to see a sight that made me lose my appetite.

Just four benches away, there sat Akua and her posse. She was not in her school uniform. She was in the Baeta House working attire. On the floor next to her was a cutlass.

I couldn’t believe it. My Akua was on internal suspension!

Just then she looked up, and our eyes locked. She gave me what can only be described as a sad smile as I took in the rest of her beautiful face.

My countenance dropped even more… not only was my Akua on inte, she was also sporting a Pythagorean hairline. Apaa Dede had laid hands on her head.

Talk about a sucky way to start a term!

The problem with girls like Emefa is that you are not the only one who noticed them.

OK, come to think of it, that’s not a ‘problem’ like she did something wrong, but it’s definitely something to be aware of. Emefa was the kind of girl who could put on makeup and pass for twenty-three. Not in a bad “growee” type of way oo — although you should remember we were about fifteen years old at the time.

How do I say this right? It was like her body completed puberty ahead of time, and she walked with the elegance of a lioness. She brought meaning to the term “catwalk”.

The young lady just turned heads; you couldn’t not notice her. Plus, you could tell she knew she was fine. She wasn’t waiting for you to tell her; she owned it.

Tirimudɛ, flattery, was not a tactic that would work on her.

As for being approached… many had tried.

All had failed.

Casualties consisted of seniors and juniors; westerners and easterners alike.

In some people’s books, she was proud; in my opinion, she was like one of those Ferrari’s with only two seats. You wouldn’t let just anybody ride shotgun in your Ferrari, would you?

This is the mountain Obodai wanted to climb.

Ambition? Maybe.

Determination? Possibly.

But how about wishful thinking? Or plain old insanity?

From where I stood, things were not looking good.

Oh… I forgot. She had a big brother in Guggisberg house. He wasn’t just her big brother, he was a BIG, scary-looking human being. Whatever they were feeding those kids at home, it was working.

But for all my objections, Obodai had done his homework. In fact, as far as planning and research go; ‘A’ for effort.

We will title Obodai’s game plan…

Step 1 – Make like a bean and stalk:

Obodai spent the entire three weeks of the vacation stalking this girl online.

(I do not advise this. It is creepy.)

Instagram wouldn’t be launched until the later part of 2010, but Facebook and Twitter were hot.

Back then, smartphones were very new and a little rare. If you had one, you were rich. People still visited internet cafes to check their Facebook walls and Twitter timelines. Those who had computers and a good internet connection at home could be found sitting behind their PC’s for ten hours in a day… just tweeting.

What was wrong with us?

I don’t know if Emefa accepted Obodai’s Facebook friend request at that time, but following people on Twitter has always been a free-for-all.

Her tweets were his bread and butter. He saw all her pictures, he knew her friends, favourite food, favourite songs, everything there was to know from that app.

The hope was that “as a woman tweeteth, so is she”, but as it turns out, people can be really fake online.

Still, it was his most logical first step under the circumstances.

Step 2 – Penetrate the friend circle:

On a typical day, when Akua showed up, Obodai would vanish; he knew I would forget he existed anyway. But with the start of the third term, he seemed to stick around a lot more. Almost like a rash.

He was there while we were hanging out during snack breaks, SU meetings, entertainment, everywhere. And he wasn’t quiet too.

He cracked all these dry jokes, which for some weird reason Akua seemed to love, and he laughed at his own jokes like a drug dealer getting high on his own supply. The boy was testing me, chale, he was testing me.

Soon enough, what used to be “Kodzooooooooooo” from Akua was turning into “Hi Kodzooo (you see it’s shorter?), hey Obodaaaiii!” Like, bruh! You dey steal my shine!

But slowly and surely, he was inserting himself into Akua’s field of vision, and it was only a matter of time before the rest of her squad, and by extension, Emefa, noticed him.

So far so good.

Step 3 – Planned coincidences:

This is the hardest step. A lot of the classical romance stories of our childhood involved some random boy-meets-girl accident that led to an innocent establishment of interest.

100% fiction.

My friend, the love of your life will not run into you in a corridor and drop their books so you can help them pick it up in slow motion with romantic music playing in the background.

That formula works only in Hollywood.

Nevertheless, it is a sentiment that television and the media have primed us for, and Obodai took advantage of it in a way that shocked even me. That evil genius!

Seriously, this is some Michael Scofield, Raymond Reddington, Money Heist Professor next level orchestration.

You see, as soon as you enter high school in Ghana, you are given three books for English, which you will be tested on in your final exams, the WASSCE.

Some year-groups read books like “Ancestral Sacrifice”, and “The Gods Are Not To Blame”. We were reading “Grief Child” — I still hate that book — and “In the Chest of a Woman”.

Somehow Obodai managed to borrow Akua’s copy of “In the Chest of a Woman”. I think he said he wanted to “see something”.

Did he read it? For what? His plan was simple; instead of returning it to her directly, he decided to return it through Emefa. Just look at the tact. Too simple and innocent to fail.

To be honest, I was impressed.

Emefa was in Science 3, right next to our class, so the arguments for distance were sound. I didn’t follow him in there though. Science 3 was full of academic terrorists. While we argued about football in Science 4, the good people of Science 3 argued about orbital hybridization. Over the years, they would sweep countless awards to further assert their dominance as the sharks on the block. No way I was entering that class to provide moral support on a romantic quest.

Whatever happened in that class, I don’t know, but let me continue with what I know…

There were more steps that needed to be executed, but we had been in school for just two weeks. At entertainment that weekend, we got our first sense of how well, or not, Obodai was doing in his current pursuit.

It was Saturday evening, and entertainment was underway. It was the first entertainment for the term, and as usual, it was a Records Night.

While the people danced in the heat of the crowded assembly hall, those of us who wouldn’t (or couldn’t), walked around semi-aimlessly, chatting the night away. As we walked, Obodai explained the details of his brilliant master plan and how the pieces were falling together just the way he liked.

Right on cue, we ran into Akua and her squad. By now, they all knew me, so walking over to them was not a hustle. For Obodai however, he had to take his time. It didn’t help that he was wearing my over-sized trousers either. (His trousers had been seized during the inspection at the door when we returned from the vacation.)

I hollered at all of my girls, Akua, Nhyie, Ama, Nancy and Emefa. And yes, I called them “my girls”, you got a problem?

Obodai stood there shyly with his hands in his pocket. Plenty big “master plan” talk, but the boy was still a wimp. Sad, very- “Obodai, I have a question.”

My jaw dropped! It was Emefa! Emefa was talking to Obodai?! Unprovoked?! The boy’s plan was actually working?? He shot me a quick look that said: “I told you so”.

“Ask away”, Obodai replied.

“Ermmm, don’t be angry oo”, she began with a mischievous smile, “but your trousers… why?” And then everyone burst out laughing.

Fortunately, Obodai could take a joke. I was really proud of my boy. With that ice-breaking question, he had earned himself a spot on the chessboard. There was no guarantee he would capture the Queen, but at least, now he could play. See what I did there?

(No really, if you don’t get chess jokes I’ll have to come at you with an alikoto reference next time. Don’t make my work hard for me. )

When we were kids, to chook meant to pierce, or stab, like with a knife.

Over time, the definition evolved into the act of snitching. It’s still a stab, if you think about it, just in the back. This is the definition we will stick with for the rest of the story.

I can’t tell you Kev’s last name, but it rhymed with “Le Chook”, a name he earned through a very stinky situation.

Le Chook returned to school weeks after school reopened. As I have previously explained, latecomers are required by Motown law to suffer two weeks of internal suspension. It turns out, Smizzle could make all that go away, simply by omitting your name from the list of latecomers.

Smizzle had an affinity for the affluent kids in Aggrey House, and as far as we were concerned, this explained why Le Chook reported to school late with no consequences.

Naturally, a lot of the inte boys were not happy that Le Chook had a get-out-of-jail-free card, but technically, we didn’t even know that yet…

You see, when Le Chook arrived — which was more than two weeks late — there was a rumour going around. It’s kind of weird and convoluted, but I’ll do my best to explain. It starts, as did most of Aggrye House’s problems, with water—or the lack of it.

As you probably know by now, water did not flow in Aggrey House, so we had to fetch water. In addition to fetching our own water, we had to fetch water for our seniors too.

If you’re not accustomed to boarding house conventions, you’re probably thinking, “Fetch water for seniors?… I know my rights… Nobody can make me their slave…”

Please. Shut up. The boarding house will humble you.

For some of us, our morning work was actually to fetch water for the annex curators to scrub. (Bathhouses are called “annexes” in Motown.)

At dawn, every morning, we’d fetch six to eight buckets, or three to four gallons, while Sweet Sugar, the bellboy, ticked off our names for every bucket brought. If you spilt enough water on the way, he would count it as half. 🤦‍♂️

Apparently, on the day Le Chook reported to school, a parent came by the house — nobody knows who or why — and saw one form one boy carrying two buckets of water. There was an interaction, and shortly afterwards, this parent felt it was their duty to knock on Smizzle’s door and make a case for the “child slavery” going on in Aggrey House.

Now, under the circumstances, Smizzle was pissed; he doesn’t like anyone telling him how to do his job. I got the hint when he once asked me, “Are you the one to tell me how to do my job?!” So subtle, right?😂😂😂

As soon as the parent left, Smizzle entered the house, rounded up the seniors, and gave them a warning about sending juniors.

If you’ve been to the boarding house, you know what comes next… the seniors got angry, and they also came to the dorms to give the juniors their own warning about snitching—sorry, chooking. Of course, we got annoyed too, but we didn’t have anybody to warn. You don’t get to threaten anybody when you are a junior.

However, in the middle of our discussions, someone said, “Hey, what if it was Le Chook?” And Le Chook, who had been in the dorm for all of thirty minutes since his arrival, heard the question, and armed with a situation he barely understood and a question he barely heard, went to Smizzle and said… well, I don’t know what he said, but somehow he convinced Smizzle that… Hey! Come to think of it, what the heck could he possibly have said to get Smizzle that worked up?

“They are talking about me”? “They called me a snitch”? Ah, please. How was that even a problem in Smizzle’s mind??? Or he was like, “Ooooh, they called my favourite dadaba a wuss.”

After ten years I’m getting angry all over again. 🤦‍♂️😦

To be honest, I wasn’t even in the dorm at that point. I was off somewhere… trying to solve world peace or something. And the day went on as usual through evening dining to prep.

After prep, I rushed back to the house, grabbed a bucket, and headed off to the dining hall to fetch water for the next morning’s bath before the dining hall got locked for the night. I was being productive. I felt good. Until we got back…

“Herh! You! Are you in C-Dorm?!” Smizzle shouted.

“Yes sir.” What a mistake.

We had just returned from the dining hall, and I was carrying two buckets on the pathway leading up to the common room entrance. I wasn’t even actually in the house yet.

Smizzle was looking at me from inside the common room, hand clutching a cane, fuming, like I’d killed his dog.

The whole house was in the common room, which was uncommon on a weeknight. Smizzle had called for an “emergency” meeting.

“Come here!” he shouted. This wasn’t the time to seek an explanation. You do not use your questions to annoy a short man with a cane. Learn this and avoid trouble.

Three strokes of the cane later, I was rubbing my butt and gritting my teeth as I tried to make sense of what had just happened. If there was any consolation, I was not alone: everyone in C-Dorm got three strokes, except for those in form 3; they got six. 😂 That was fun to watch, but my butt still hurt.

When the bloodbath was over, Smizzle began a speech to explain what happened.

“Let this be a warning. Mmmm?” He ended every sentence with “Mmmm?”.

“Those of you who talk to strangers and gossip. Mmmm? If I hear that something like this repeats itself, mmmm, I will be back with my cane for everybody. Mmmm?”

I still didn’t know what had happened. My butt demanded an explanation, and Smizzle was yet to make any sense.

“Where’s Le Chook?” he continued.

(Of course, he didn’t say “Le Chook”, but allow me, it’s my story.)

Addressing Le Chook, he said, “If you hear anybody saying anything about you again, come straight to my house and tell me. Mmmm?”

Le Chook could barely nod. Here he was standing in front of the whole house, an obvious snitch, even though I was yet to find out what had gone on leading up to this. But you think I was pissed, you should have seen the faces of the form three’s.

Smizzle had been a housemaster long enough to know that the boy was dead if he didn’t do something, so he added a warning for the seniors.

“Anyone who dares to touch you, let me know immediately. Mmmm? Where is Eben? And the rest of the form three’s, are you listening? Mmmm? If I catch you maltreating him because he reported you, you will have to deal with me. Mmmm? You may leave.”

Just like that, it was over. We all left for the dorms. Le Chook, however, was not very sure what to do.

While i was being filled in on why Smizzle had just whooped our butts, Le Chook entered the dorm. The silence that met him was so heavy, you could hear a cricket fart.

He moved straight to his trunk, changed into his pajamas and crawled into bed without saying a word.

For the next two weeks we treated Le Chook like he didn’t exist.

It was quite sad, and it didn’t help that Smizzle made him start taking his meals at his house, and holding his hand and walking around like a little girl. Nah, for real, you could find them walking hand-in-hand every now and then. You can’t make this stuff up.

Eventually, though, boys will be boys, and we will forget, but there were a few things that hastened the return to normalcy.

First of all, the people in the other dorms didn’t get lashed, so Le Chook still had people to talk to in the house. Plus his chopbox was a good tool for reconciliation. Then visiting day came and he brought enough chicken to pacify some of the seniors. Under the influence of food, and the fact that I was trying to be a good Christian, the passage of time slowly erased the pettiness and we finally found it in our hearts to treat Le Chook like a human being again.

So this snitch didn’t get stitches. Not this time at least.

I guess the exception to the rule is that you should have a housemaster with a cane in your corner. And he should have a “good relationship” with your parents too.🤑

So that’s the story of how I earned my first stripes in Motown. By stripes, I mean lashes. Like “By His stripes, we are healed”, you barb?

The Motowners reading this probably sat up when they saw the title. Everyone who’s had anything to do with Motown in the last decade knows the green Kia Shuma. Anybody involved with Motown in the last 40 years knows its rider.

It was more or less the Batmobile of Motown. And every Batmobile needs a Batman. Say hello to the Batman of Motown, Kassa.

In the early days, Kassa drove an old beat-up white Opel Astra.

At first glance, he was an unassuming balding man, Kassa. But you couldn’t spend a week in Motown without learning to be wary of that name. His name was treated with the same fear that students of Hogwarts ascribed to Lord Voldermort. At least, in the old days.

A few months ago I asked one form one boy whether Kassa was still making waves in the school. He said, “Who’s Kassa?” I almost gagged.

There’s no single answer to this question. It’s harder than it has to be.

Kassa was my Core Mathematics teacher, and a good one at that.

If I’m being honest, he is the best mathematics teacher I’ve ever had. I know a lot of students who would agree that this man changed their approach to the soup of numbers, letters and symbols that is math. I still remember his explanation of simultaneous equations using ballistic missile interception. He brought a new zest to mathematics, but “Kassa the math teacher” barely describes Kassa.

Kassa was also a housemaster. A feared housemaster. The terror, if you will, of Fraser House on the West. When it comes to stories of Kassa as a housemaster, we need a whole book. One post is not enough.

I could tell you about the time some students were breaking bounds late at night when Kassa dropped out of a tree and apprehended them.

I could tell you about the times when he would dress up as a student, and walk into the dorms under the cover of darkness during a power outage to eavesdrop on students gossiping about him.

Or how about the time he met some students who had broken bounds at the Papaye fast food restaurant at Tesano? He put his arms around them and took a selfie. That picture was the only evidence needed at the disciplinary committee.

Or how about the other group of students he met at Papaye? (No, I don’t know what his deal was with Papaye) This time he drove them back to school, and put their food in his freezer for a week. Rumour has it he gave the frozen rice and chicken to them to eat. Like I said, rumour.

There’s more. A lot more. Stories of students made to dig useless pits as deep as they were tall, only to fill them back up… for nothing.

Stories of cricket, his favourite game, and teddy bears.

Stories of heart-warming kindness and a cold absence of empathy.

Considering that he was in charge of allocating work to the people on internal suspension, Akua hated his guts. She was not alone in her hatred. There are all kinds of stories, chale, but the Kassa we knew was just a product of who Kassa was in the 80’s.

The real Emperor Bokassa was a 20th-century African dictator. After two quick Google searches, I’d rather not know anything else about the man. He’s like the wickedest man you never heard of.

That’s how Kassa got the name “Bokassa”, later shortened to “Kassa”, back in the 80’s; back when he was a student, and the Senior Prefect of Motown.

Yep! Kassa was an old “School P”, and not any regular School P.

Heck, he’s arguably the most popular School P since 1927. As a Senior Prefect, Kassa’s story was the stuff of legend. It wasn’t because he was a stellar student, which he was; it wasn’t because he was strict, which he certainly was; it wasn’t even because he was uncompromisingly mean.

It was because, for almost one whole term, Kassa doubled as the headmaster of Motown, after overthrowing the actual headmaster. 😂

I cannot make this stuff up. The idea is so ridiculous, I wouldn’t mention it if it was not a historical fact.

Boss-level ‘hard-guyness’.

Do you realize how much influence you need to have to orchestrate a coup d’etat, In high school of all places?!

What could possibly have led to students overthrowing a whole headmaster? Well… once again, there are many stories, but two popular ones stick out.

The first says that the headmaster was a weird occultist who used to walk around the school barefoot. Not that there’s such a thing as a regular occultist, but I’m just relaying a story here. I wasn’t there.

The second story says that the headmaster was mismanaging the school and its resources. I know, the second one sounds more reasonable, but where’s the fun in that? 😂😂😂 Once again, I wasn’t there.

All I know is that one day the headmaster was in his office when Kassa and about a dozen other seniors walked into this man’s office and asked him to leave and never come back.😅 The boys had just one job: if he refused to leave, they were going to carry him out! See? Hard guy!

I bet you’ve seen all kinds of freedom fighters in your day, but I dare you to show me a student who dethroned their headmaster. I’ll wait.

There are many more stories. One of my favourites involves Reggie Rockstone and a nightclub where Kassa was undercover, catching students who had gone clubbing.

But let’s move past this crazy throwback.

Kassa was late to class that Friday morning. It was very unlike him. We kept looking out of the window in search of the white Opel Astra that would announce his arrival. The man made us jittery.

After fifteen minutes a green Kia Shuma pulled up in front of the form one block. We didn’t know that car. Maybe it was an old student, we thought.

Technically, we were right. Kassa stepped out of the car and jogged — yes, for some reason, he jogged a lot — into 1 Science 4. The class went deathly quiet. Without offering a greeting, he scribbled a number of equations on one side of the board.

“I have a meeting with the headmistress. You have thirty minutes to finish this.” And with that, he was off, jogging back to his new car.

As he opened the door and sat in, we could hear the buzz of whispers across the block as everyone realized that Batman had a new batmobile.

He reversed out of the parking space like he was hot on the tail of the Joker, then sped off towards the administration block, heading to the principal’s office. The same office where thirty years earlier, he had asked a man thirty years his senior to leave and shut the doors behind him.

The days of the Opel were over. The Kia Shuma was the new symbol of terror.

Kassa was in McCarthy House, back when it was a boys house. That was also former president J.J. Rawlings’ house. It’s another thing they have in common besides coup d’etats. I find that funny.

But really, I think Kassa is most like Papa J in this way: you can love him, you can hate him, but you can’t ignore him.

I’m not his biggest fan, neither am I his biggest critic. But to take Kassa out of the Motown story is like taking an infinity stone out of Thanos’s gauntlet. It’ll still be powerful, but it won’t snap the same. 😅

I know, I know, I need better references.

In 2010, for the first time since it’s inception, the FIFA World Cup was hosted on African soil. South Africa 2010 was Africa’s first opportunity to host—and hopefully win—the world’s greatest football trophy.

You remember, don’t you? You cried too, didn’t you? Such painful memories. Suarez. Hmmm. We’ll get to that.

Anyhoo, sometime at the beginning of our stay in Aggrey House, Smizzle lined up all the form 1’s and made us answer the same question one after another; “What work do your parents do?”

According to him, it was to get an idea of how some parents could provide expertise with various development projects around the house. I never bought that. I always figured it was a genius strategy to rank parents according to the S.I. unit of “wallet-weight”.

One discovery Smizzle made that day was Kwabena, whose dad was a sports journalist. Before the world cup started, he offered to have a DSTV satellite installed in the house. Makes sense, right? Sports journalist… Super Sports. Mind you, it was 2010; DSTV was still the reserve of dadaba people, so Smizzle was excited. We were too.

Two weeks before the World Cup began, a technician came around and hooked us up. We returned to the house after lunch to the wonderful realization that we had joined the ranks of the dadaba-by-DSTV order. The crystal-clear feed from “Super Sports 3” was proof that our level had changed. There was only one problem…

Riddle riddle. what do you call a TV without a remote controller? An annoyance.

Organic chemistry was hard, but eventually, I figured it out. One thing I never figured out was how Smizzle justified keeping both the decoder and remote controller for our new DSTV in his house.

If you wanted to change the channel, you had to go to his house, knock on his door, and say, “Sir, good afternoon. Please, we would like to watch Cartoon Network.” Seeing as you cannot imagine saying those words to your housemaster or housemistress, you can safely assume that 99% of the time we watched what Smizzle wanted to watch.

I told you organic chemistry made more sense.

Essentially, Kwabena’s dad had unwittingly upgraded Smizzle’s TV experience, and he was “allowing” us to watch his DSTV with him. Brilliant! Super-villain level brilliance! But let’s get back to the World Cup.

The World Cup excitement was tangible. South Africa brought their A-game… the country, not their football team—their team sucked.

The “Jabulani”, their custom football design, became an international sensation. Vuvuzela horns also sold across the continent like hotcakes. The World Cup music that year was far better than any other year I can remember.

Shakira and her ‘unlying’ hips dropped “Waka Waka” (AKA “Zamenamena”) which became the ring tone on my yam phone for a while. Coca-Cola got in on the lyrical action too with “Waving Flag“, which was so moving it felt like a spiritual anthem.

What a time to be alive!

Ghana’s Black Stars were doing quite well on the pitch too, all things considered. For our second appearance in the World Cup, I must confess, we were pulling our weight.

In other schools, especially the boys’ schools, I’m pretty sure prep was forgotten for the entirety of the World Cup season. Not in Motown.

Most likely, the heads of administration would have wanted to keep us at prep in the evenings, but there were two obvious problems; the teachers, who would have to supervise, also wanted to watch, and if the students were overly provoked, the crazy ones could incite a riot. So as the games progressed, we started out with no prep on the days when Ghana had a match and quickly switched to a house prep system.

House prep meant we were supposed to spend the prep time studying, but let’s be real; who studies during the World Cup? It was football galore, and the random shouts of “GOOOAAALL!!!” and sounds of vuvuzelas in the evenings confirmed that everybody had taken a football break. In the words of King Solomon, “There is a time for everything.” It was time for football.

In fact, the football fever was so strong that the Motown German club flew some of its members to South Africa for the World Cup. On one of the days, they got to eat breakfast with the German national team. Maaaaad!

If ever I cared about speaking German, it was then. To clear all doubts, my German has remained like my Ewe: useless. It definitely doesn’t match a surname like Ametewee-Nutakor.

(If only I had an Akan surname, like “Agyapon” or something. 🤭🤭🤭)

Our boys, the Black Stars, were doing really well. The group stages had been a little shaky, but we had made it through.

We met with the USA and kicked the butts of Obama’s boys. We were in the quarter-finals; the farthest any African nation had ever come in the world cup.

Standing between us and making history by entering the semi-finals was Uruguay.

We were going to make it. We knew it. Our boys were on fire. Nothing was going to stop us.

That evening, supper was served early in the dining hall so we could finish in time for the start of the match.

Food? What is food when your national team is about to make history? Forget the food. We were shii-ing jama and making noise—boys and girls alike. The prefects gave up on trying to maintain order and rang the bell for the end of dining.

We returned to our houses, and for the next hour we were giddy with excitement. Noise be what?

Super Sports was clear like something. Herh!

Finally, finally, finally, they began to play our national anthem. I’ve never been more patriotic in my life. We put our hands on our chests and sang with vim and vigour.

The support of every African was behind us. Every African power, physical and spiritual, from pastors to juju-men, was behind us. We sang with pride, “🎶–And help us to resist oppressors’ rule, with all our will and might forevermoooooooooore!!🎶“ Then we let out a blood-curdling yell and resounding applause for nobody in particular.

A few minutes later, the match kicked off! #Sigh

At this point, I’d like to borrow the narration of the story from my friend, Joojo’s WhatsApp status, which he shared on the 10th anniversary of that match. You see, I knew I wasn’t the only one who still had this memory fresh in my mind. Heck, I’ll throw in a video. Try not to cry.

It’s been over ten years but I still remember the heartbreak.

Herh! Suarez!

Herh Baby Jet!

Heeeeeerh!!!

Hard guys were crying. Like, real, actual tears.

After all our previous games we would run from girls’ house to girls’ house to shii jama and dance in the streets till teachers came and chased us away. But not that evening. That evening we were beaten, sad, angry, demoralized. It would prove to be the end of my status as a football fan. There was only so much my heart could take.

The next day there was no entertainment. The remaining matches were supposed to be our entertainment, but they were just a horrible reminder of our defeat. I think the whole school just slept.

Sunday came swiftly, and the chaplain on duty tried to cheer us up. He tried to explain to us that we were still winners in spite of everything. He must have been very desperate to see us smile because he quoted D.J. Khaled… in a sermon!

He said, “Frieeeendsss, I like that song you guys sing at entertainment. [* dramatic pause *] ‘Win, win, win, no matter what!'”

There was silence for a full five seconds as we tried to process what we had heard, then the whole chapel erupted in laughter as we realised that the Reverend Father was trying to sing “All I Do Is Win”.

I saw Akua later that day. She cheered me up a little. Only a little.

The real joy was that it was a visiting Sunday, and my mom brought the ultimate comforter: jollof rice. There was still some meaning to life after all.

Later that evening, Ronny, the B-Dorm senior, arrived from South Africa with the rest of the German club ambassadors. Apparently, it was more painful for them seeing the loss with their naked eyes. Also, exams would start the following week, and they were not about to risk their grades dropping to watch another country win the World Cup.

That evening, the B-Dorm seniors had a blast. Ronny was showing them pictures from South Africa on his little digital camera when M.O.B. had a brilliant idea. Why not go back to South Africa right there in B-Dorm?

And go they did. That’s how our World Cup story ended. Right there in B-Dorm, some of the seniors, M.O.B., Armani, Kɛjɛ, Wuloo and a few others, grabbed Aaron’s winter coats (July is winter in the southern hemisphere) and took pictures pretending to be in South Africa. Of course, they took some with Ronny. That way, mixing their pictures with his actual South Africa album, they managed to convince a few girls on Facebook that they had been to see the World Cup.

You call it deception, they called it a silver lining. 🤣🤣🤣

If you must know, things were really… ermmm… nice, between Akua and me; lots of laughter and nice conversations.

She started prepping in Science 4 on Sundays so I could help her with Integrated Science Chemistry. Every Sunday, we’d join our desks, I’d sit on the left, she’d sit on my right, and we’d have a chemistry textbook in the middle; you could say “there was chemistry between us”.

Don’t leave meeeee!!!!

And them dimplesssss 😍. Every time she understood a new concept, her face would light up, and as her lips curled upwards into a smile, I would see my reward at the corners of her mouth. 😍😍😍 #sighhhh

I hate Chemistry with a passion, but not that term. That term, I almost loved chemistry. 🤣

It was also nice to be able to pull Obodai and Emefa into some of the fun. They were actually getting along really well. Nothing official, but they were getting kind of close. We would all sit together during entertainment, especially on movie nights. One of our favourites was “2012”, the end-of-the-world movie that predicted we would all die by 2012. 🤦‍♂️

So yeah, that’s pretty much an Akua update.

The most dramatic thing that had happened to me since the World cup happened the next Monday. The day after visiting is a bad day for squatter curators, those who clean the shanks, the potties. After the hell-fire mix of visiting meals… wait, you’re not eating, are you? 🤣 I think I should avoid details.

But you get the point, you did not want to be a squatter curator the day after visiting.

Boys would show up and spoil there. In fact, after school, on those days, there would always be a line of people waiting to use the squatters, because as soon as the door of the house was opened, everybody who had been holding things in for dear life would race to make their ‘deposit’.

On that fateful Monday, I was the last person to make it to the only squatter left. Right behind me was Armani, a B-Dorm senior. I entered the stall, pulled down my shorts and sat. I had forgotten to lock the door.

Before I could give the required ‘push’, the door was flung open, and a strong hand grabbed my arm and threw me out of the stall half-naked. As it turned out, Armani needed to go much more badly than I needed to.

I could have complained… I should have complained… but he was bigger than me… and he locked the door. I’ve never made that mistake again. Lock your doors, people, lock your doors.

Other things happened, just that I was not involved. Let’s see what I can remember. Alright, I’ll throw around some names as if you know them. It’s the events that matter, after all.

There was a ‘fight’ between Layers and Supra. I think they are both Tema boys. In fact, Layers deserves his own episode, honestly.

I can’t say who won, because the fight didn’t actually happen. I remember Layers picked a stone, then Supra picked another stone because, in his words, “stones are free”, and then they kinda danced around each other for forty-five seconds hoping someone would separate them before it became obvious they were both not as hard as they were acting.

Well, Elorm, the assistant house prefect, passed by, and they dropped their act… and their stones.

So yeah, they owe us a fight, ‘cos nobody was going to stop them. 😂😂

What else? What else?

Oh yeah, so Jordor gave Solo a haircut with a shaving stick. 🤣 The details are fuzzy, but Solo wanted a fade, Jordor said he could do it, and Solo entrusted his head to Jordor. Apaa Dede would have been a better option.

Fast forward, Solo had his fade, and he actually thought he looked fly. I promise you, he was proud of himself.

When Eben, the house prefect, saw him, he half-screamed — out of actual worry — “Herh, young man, who did this to you?!”

His initial impression was that someone had pranked the boy and shaved his hair in his sleep; we were very close to Akpakus after all. It made no sense to him that anyone would actually want to look like he had been attacked by a lawnmower.

What was Solo’s response? In his thick Ewe accent, “Ehnn, e no be Jordor? Me I tell am say I want shape wey e come tear me fade-out.”

If you don’t understand pidgin, I’m sorry. 😂😂 I won’t bother translating. It’s not funny in proper English. The mere idea that this was the result of a voluntary action tickled Eben so much that he forgot to punish them. At least, until the next day.

Sometimes I believed he’d rather die than let an offence go.

I think I’ve mentioned Hala Week before. Maybe I didn’t explain what it is.

If by some miracle of dadaba-ness you don’t know what it is, it’s typically the last week of school before vacation, or any period in school where provisions and money are in short supply.

Anyway, now, here we were at the end of another term, and as usual, Hala Week was upon us. Our heads were full of knowledge, but our chopboxes were empty. Some people had cash, but try eating a twenty cedi note after studying till midnight. Our boxes were so empty, they stopped locking the chop box rooms.

It was so bad, I saw some Guggisberg boys looking for gari in Aggrey House. That’s like a Kardashian looking for gɔbɛ at the Legon Night Market. It’s serious.

In my own box, I had only a handful of cornflakes, another handful of gari and the laaaaast of my chocolate spread. No money.

One of those nights, moved by hunger, I just mixed the cornflakes with the chocolate spread and made myself eat it. Please, don’t ask. All that was left was my last gari.

What a lot of people don’t know is the brain accounts for just 2% of the body’s weight, but uses 20% of the body’s energy. If you’re going to make somebody study, FEED THEM!

The day before our last paper, I was so hungry I didn’t know what to do with myself. Sounds funny now, but my life was hanging in the balance, chale.

I went to Gbewee. “Chale, Gbewee, adey hong oo.”

He laughed very hard as he opened his empty chop box to prove to me, “Adey hong pass you sef.”

I thought all hope was lost, but Diaby made an offer, “I get shito, you get gari?”

Music to my ears! It was time for a collaboration.

I ran downstairs to my chop box and brought my last gari upstairs. All the while I was singing a sweet tune in my head. I felt like that widow Elijah met. The one who was going to cook her last meal and die, only to have that life-changing encounter. I was going to meet my life-changing shito; I was going to—

I stopped.

I felt deceived. I had arrived at the C-Dorm inner chamber, and sitting in front of Diaby was a shito jar, but it was filled with shito oil, not actual shito. Herh! No be small fraud! But a beggar has no choice.

As we mixed the gari with the shito, I remember thinking to myself “Is this what I have been reduced to?” 😭 Like, heeeeerh!

Nevertheless, I salivated as we mixed the gari with that oil. Hunger don’t know bougie.

I remember the relief as the course aggregates travelled down my throat and settled into my empty stomach. Somehow, the oil had retained enough of the shito taste to be worth it. Or maybe I was just that hungry.

The meal, if you can call it that, was so scanty, I knew hunger would ambush me in the next thirty minutes, so I made a counter move. I went back to the common room, packed my books, and went to bed. No amount of mathematics was going to save me from night-time peckishness if I stayed up late.

As I jumped, literally jumped, into my top bunk bed, I felt some gratitude because my tummy had stopped rumbling. In less than 48 hours I would be home for a two-month vacation. And we would come back to start form 2. Semi-seniors in our own right. Things weren’t so bad after all.

I think that gashit gave me a sore throat, but at least I had survived form 1. I smiled at the thought as I drifted off into sleep like a baby… which is a bad analogy when you realise that babies wake up to cry every couple of hours. But you get the picture. 😉

There’s a certain verse in the book of Ecclesiastes. It reads like this:

    Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof…

    Ecclesiastes 7:8 

I guess it depends on what that “thing” is… but certainly, generally, better is the end of an academic term than the beginning. I think most people would agree.

My last paper of that first year wasn’t bad. I don’t remember what it was, but that only means it did not rock me. At the very least I can be sure it wasn’t P.E.

Anyway, another term was ending, and the next time I set foot in Motown, I was going to be in form 2. I would finally be somebody’s senior. It was a good feeling. The feeling of a survivor. E dey be pass.

We actually finished our last paper quite early, so there was a lot of noise on the form one block during the break time. Akua and I went to get vitale and mini-sausage rolls at the Home Economics block; the same place we’d gone together on my birthday a few months earlier. This time, I insisted on paying, and she let me. As usual, we laughed a lot, but I noticed that she seemed ever so slightly… edgy, maybe? Like she was thinking about something half the time.

That last paper must have been tough for her, I assumed. There was no point in spoiling the mood, however. Tomorrow would just have to worry about itself. I pushed the thoughts aside, and we enjoyed our snack and walked back to the form one block. If it were any other school, I would have said we walked back hand-in-hand, but not in Motown. In case I haven’t told you before, holding hands is a punishable offence in Motown. Do your body “Papa Romantic”, and you’ll be shocked to find yourself swinging a cutlass in the bush as your punishment.

Finally, the school bell rang for the end of the day, and by extension, the end of the term, and the end of an academic year.

Ahead of us were two long months of vacation enjoyment—no seniors, no bells. Sweet sweet rest. No bells and no seniors. The soft life.

One of the formalities left to be taken care of was the closing assembly. Students who had been caught cheating during exams were called to the front and thoroughly disgraced.

Rev B also got worked up about our noise-making and made us bow our heads “in shame” and ask for forgiveness.

To crown it all, we endured the boring speeches and announcements. Same old, same old.

There was something worth noting though: one of the Kingsley housemistresses was going to become an assistant headmistress. We were going to start the next academic year with three headmistresses… and thus, the Powerpuff Girls were born!

You know how people like the Powerpuff Girls and think they are cute? The whole “sugar, spice and everything nice” vibe? Yeah, these gals were not it. Chemical X nkoaa, ei! But that’s not a story for today.

The chapel prefect gave the announcements; Aggrey form one boys were going to be taking down the canopies at the chapel. That was hard and dirty work, so I was annoyed.

After a short while, the closing assembly was over, and everyone was excitedly leaving the chapel to go and begin packing for our departure the next day. Everyone except Aggrey form 1 boys, of course.

I meant to ask Akua if she he had any plans for the vacation, but somehow I had forgotten during break time. I’d been hearing good things about a new cinema that had recently opened at the Accra mall (yes, Silverbird had come fresh-fresh), and I was thinking of gathering my coins so I could take Akua to go see a movie. Of course, that would depend on a few factors, like the price of a ticket, whether she would actually want popcorn and a drink during the movie, whether she didn’t mind sitting in a trotro, and most importantly whether or not she was allowed to leave her house… but one thing at a time. I didn’t want to get ahead of myself.

I saw Akua and her posse slowly leaving the chapel. They were discussing something, but I didn’t know what, and I didn’t have time to find out.

“Hi Ama, hi Emefa, hi Nhyie, hi Nancy”, I piped.

The chorus of “Hey Kodzoo”, “Hi Kodzoooo” was always refreshing, and they made Akua blush a little. She still seemed a little edgy though, as she gave me a weak, yet genuine, smile. Her squad began to peel off to give us some room to ourselves, which was quite nice of them.

“You don’t look too good,” I said. She tried to widen her smile. “I’m fine”, came her reply.

“I’m not buying that. Was it the last paper?” I asked.

She laughed. Like she really laughed, “Ah no! That easy thing?”

“Then what’s up?” I asked, a little relieved.

“Ermm, well there is something, but… but… I’ll tell you tomorrow, okay?”

I could see in her eyes that she was getting uncomfortable, so I let it go.

“Anyway”, I said, lightening the mood, “how would you like to go and see a movie with me at that new cinema at the mall?”

Her eyes lit up, and then a thoughtful look came over her, like she had remembered whatever it was she was thinking about again. “Ermmm, it depends-“

All of a sudden, “HERH! KODZO!!!” a rude loud voice interrupted, “your mates are working on the canopies and you’re gating!” (‘Gating’ is what we called it when a boy and girl were off by themselves chatting romantically)

My heart skipped a beat as I spun around to face the owner of the voice. It was Elorm; the assistant Aggrey House prefect. I opened my mouth to explain, but the boy wasn’t done shouting. “I’m not listening to any explanation. Cloq!”

At this point, I realise I have achieved a wonderful feat by writing about a year’s worth of experiences in Motown without once using the word “cloq”. Mind you, this is a word we heard almost everyday. It means “kneel down”. Don’t ask me where the word came from—I’m as clueless as you are. All I know is that in the next two seconds I was on my knees, cloqing in front of Akua in embarrassment.

“I’m so sorry, I’ll see you tomorrow”, she whispered and took off. She knew things would only get worse for me if she hung around. Elorm seemed proud of himself for destroying my moment. If he had his way, he would have cloqed Akua too, but fortunately, assistant house prefects couldn’t go about distributing punishments to students in other houses. It just wasn’t done.

I went on to spend close to twenty minutes kneeling at the back of the chapel, before being allowed to stand up and join the canopy work. Honestly, I preferred the floor. But as I knelt down, all I kept asking myself was, “Why did she say ‘it depends'”? Depends on what? And what was eating her up? I had this very unsettling feeling. A very very unsettling feeling. I brushed the thought out of my mind and focused my attention on insulting Elorm. In my head of course.

The next morning couldn’t come fast enough. The night dragged on and on. The Akpakus pranks didn’t help much either.

The seniors were trying out this new prank where they would send you to go pick a book from some guy in another house. The catch was, this person didn’t exist, and the seniors in the other houses knew it. But they wouldn’t tell you. In fact, they’d say something like, “Oh, Kwamena Gyamerah? Right now norr he go G’berg.” (He just went to Guggisberg House) Then this poor junior would go to Guggisberg House and find another senior who would send him off to Livingstone House, then off to another house and so on… until after about an hour, some random senior would have pity and show him the joke.

Of course, the realization that you just spent an hour chasing a phantom all over the school was anything but funny, but the seniors got a kick out of it. Obodai was sent on one of such wild-goose chases. He was not amused.

I managed to steer clear of a lot of trouble that night. I’m not sure how; I just did.

I also heard a rumour that night that Elorm had taken the SAT’s and would not be returning the next term. I was so happy… for me, not for him. Honestly, I was hoping he’d go and flunk his courses—which he never did because he was as bright as he was wicked—but I was just glad I wouldn’t have to deal with him the next year.

If you’re thinking I didn’t like the guy, well… what gave it away? 😂

Moving on, morning came, and I knew to expect Akua on the East since the school rules had all but evaporated on vacation day. I was not wrong. She actually came to the eastern dining hall for breakfast that morning. When I entered the dining hall I was surprised to see her sitting at one of the Clark House tables with some of her friends.

The last dining session is always a joke; there’s no order, and a lot of people don’t even come.

She waited for breakfast to be over, and for most of the people to leave the dining hall, and then she walked over to C19, where I sat alone. She knew I’d be waiting.

“Hi”, she said. She looked better than the previous day, but you could still see some uncertainty in her eyes.

“Hi”, I replied.

“So”, she began, “yesterday, that was kinda awkward with your house prefect, wasn’t it?”

I laughed hesitantly. Elorm had really embarrassed me. It was not among my fondest memories.

“You said you’d let me know what was bugging you yesterday”, I said, changing the subject.

“Oh, straight to business like that?” she asked. “You don’t know how to play koraa.”

She said this jokingly, but you could see the discomfort returning to her face as she began to fiddle with her thumbs. Then, as if with a forced burst of internal motivation, she sucked in a deep breath and gasped out a sentence I will never forget, “You see, Kodzo, I like you… but…”

In that moment—in those few seconds—it felt like Thanos had snapped.

I knew some life altering event had just happened, but it would take a few seconds for the dust to settle. Someway, somehow, we were not going to leave that table the same, and approximately half of my world was about to disintegrate.

“But?” I choked.

You see, “I like you” is a full manifesto to a high-schooler. It’s a message of hope and promise. It’s second only to salvation. And this was the first time in my life that a girl was telling me she liked me. Me oo! Efo Kodzo Ametewee-Nutakor! And not just any girl oo… Ahoɔfɛ Akua… Akua Sweet Voice… Akua Dimples… I should have been tingling with excitement, but she had said “but”! I knew I wouldn’t like what followed.

“Please, let me finish”, she said, putting her finger on my lips like they do in the movies. There was no coronavirus. Those were different times.

“Don’t say anything”, she begged.

At this point, I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to say “I like you too”, anaa? Isn’t that what I was supposed to say? But as she took her finger off my lips my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth, and I kept quiet.

“Kodzo, I’m… I’m leaving.”

If my silence wasn’t questioning enough, the confusion on my face certainly prompted her to keep talking.

“Remember how I was on inte at the beginning of the term?” she asked. I nodded. Of course, I remembered. She had come late to school and had to do two weeks of internal suspension under Kassa. Apaa Dede had given her a Pythagorean haircut too. How could I forget? But what did that have to do with anything? And what did she mean by ‘leaving’?

“Well”, she continued, “I was late to return to school because I had to go to the embassy. The US Embassy.”

If local man had travelled before I would have begun to connect the dots, but all I knew was how to take a trotro from Dansoman to Achimota. She had to spell it out for me. “I was at the embassy for a visa application. My uncle is taking me to the US. I’ll be continuing school there.”

Her words hit me like a train. My heart did “kre-kraw”.

“Wait, what?” I asked in surprise. My own voice startled me.

“Well… yes”, she replied, rather sadly.

It had to be a joke. There had to be a catch. “You’ll come back… right?” I asked. I knew the answer: how many people do you know that went and came back?

“I… I hope so”, she offered, “but I don’t know.”

“B-But… but… I… I…”, I went silent. There was nothing I could say. The dining hall was practically empty by now. Just the two of us. She kept silent too. There really was nothing to say. My face felt hot. My eyes stung. Somehow, and I don’t know how, the tears never came. My mind flew in a thousand different directions, and I lost track of time.

I don’t know how long it was, but after some time, I felt her soft hands open mine, and she stuck a folded piece of paper into my palm—her last note to me. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. I- I didn’t know how.”

I had no response.

She continued, “I’ve had a little more time to process it, so I wrote some of my thoughts. You can read it in your own time.”

I still didn’t say anything.

We just sat there for a few more minutes while she kept rubbing the back of my hand with her thumb.

“I have to go”, she finally managed to say.

I looked up and saw the sweetest saddest smile I’d ever seen on her face, with just the faintest hint of those dimples. I could see she was hurt seeing me like this. But like she said, she’d had more time to process it. A whole term. I’d had just about ten minutes, and I was already losing sight in my left ear. 😓 Yes, I said losing sight in my left ear. That’s what happens when your heart does “kre-kraw”.

She said it again, “I have to go. My dad will be coming for me pretty soon.”

She leaned forward and gave me a kiss on the cheek. There were two thoughts in my head right then: the first was how I would get expelled if any teacher saw that, the second was that she smelled like flowers. What was wrong with me? On a normal day, that would have been a dream come true… but no…not like this.

“Bye Kodzo”, she whispered into my ear before gently planting another kiss on my cheek. I still couldn’t talk, but I squeezed her hand gently and let go. Then she turned around, and I watched for what felt like an eternity as the young lady walked down the aisle of the dining hall to the door all the way at the far end. Each step so graceful.

When she got to the door she turned around one more time and waved at me with that same sweet sad smile. I managed to curl my lips up with great effort and waved back with even greater effort. If this was the last time we would see each other, it wouldn’t be nice to have her remember me distraught. Then just like that, she stepped out of the door and was gone… along with a piece of my heart.

Herh! Hard guy ayɛ mrɛ. Your boy had gone soft.

Obodai found me in the dining hall about fifteen minutes later. I was sitting in the same position. By some miracle I had still not cried, I hadn’t moved, I hadn’t said a word. I hadn’t even read her note; I just stuck it in my pocket and sat there.

“Kodzo. Ah, you dey here. Your poppie come oo.” Obviously, he had been looking for me for a while.

I didn’t tell him what had happened. I waited for a few weeks before mustering the strength to tell him anything. I didn’t want anybody’s pity.

“You make fine?”, he asked. “Yeah”, I managed a fake laugh, “then adey think small.”

He didn’t seem satisfied with my answer, but my dad had been waiting for a while, and we had to leave in a hurry.

As circumstances would have it, Emefa would go on to start dating one of the seniors from Gyamfi House during that long vacation, and Obodai would return to high school ‘bachelorhood’ with me the next term. Turns out that was comforting. Misery, they say, loves company.

As we walked out of the dining hall, the sky seemed less blue, and the trees seemed less green. It would take a while for things to get back to normal.

It should have ended in tears, and I was certainly messed up inside, but I just couldn’t bring myself to cry. It’s either a miracle or I have malfunctioning tear glands. Choose your choice.

I started with some words from wise King Solomon, it’s only fair that I end with a few more:

    …Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.

    Song of Solomon 8:4 

Somebody should have told me this earlier.

Hey, come to think of it, my dad did tell me. 🤔 Not in those exact words, but he did, on the day he dropped me off at Aggrey House for the first time. His words were, “And don’t follow girls! You hear me? They are dangerous! Your mother and I have brought you here to learn… Do you hear me?”

Guess who didn’t hear him… me.

Focus on your studies, kids. Love no be beans.

(You’ll have to forgive the excessive shorthand.)

    Hey Kodzo,

    Ummm… where do I start?

    I think “sorry” is the best place 2 begin. So yeah, I’m sorry. Like really really sorry.

    I don’t even noe what 2 say. I wanted 2 tell u, but it neva felt lyk de ryt tym. It always felt lyk I was going 2 spoil de mood, so I just kept quiet de whole tym.

    I hope u can 4give me.

    Take care, ok?

    xoxo

    Akua, Aqua

Spoil the mood? Spoil the mood??? Liwin said it best, “Painsssss, Painsssss, P-E-Double-T-E, Painssss!”

Once you get past the childish shorthand, the message produced the same effect as a sledgehammer to the heart! The “xoxo” at the end koraa was annoying me.

I mean, what do you do when your almost-girlfriend ditches you and leaves the country? No, seriously, what do you do? Tell meeeee. 🤕

That vacation was a bag of mixed feelings; I would be walking about, feeling okay, living my best life, then I would see something that reminded me of her (like dimples 😭) and then I would shout “Heeeerh!”. It was rough, chale, it was rough.

Nice girl that she was, she tried to check on me in those first few weeks through Facebook. It just made things worse. It was like I was not allowed to eat, but waakye was checking whether I was hungry. Messed up, right?!

So I asked her to stop. On the night she finally left the country I was not even aware. There was no point fighting, and so like Elsa I let it go.

Eventually, the two months of vacation rolled by, and with the first week of September came a new term, and my eventual return to the boarding house. This time, however, I was going to be in form 2! I was going to be someone’s senior! I was finally going to… hol’ up. There was a problem:

You see, back in 2010, under the administration of His Excellency Agya Atta, there was a change in policy from the then-recently-ended Kuffuor administration regarding education. President Kuffuor had switched high school from a 3-year program to a 4-year program, and Agya Atta had switched it back to three years. So now, those previously in form 3 were in form 4, and many schools in Ghana did not yet have the capacity to accommodate a fourth year group, so the new form 1’s, the people supposed to be enrolled to assume all the suffering of the then-current form 2’s, aka ‘us’, would not be entering the boarding houses until November! November la!

Let me be calming down. In simple English, we were not anyone’s seniors in any practical terms. We were still going to do donkey work for another two months while the new first-year students attended school as day students until Motown bought enough beds. Herh!

So we arrived on campus, and nothing had changed. Nothing. Oh wait, that wicked assistant house prefect had written the SAT’s and left the country to attend university abroad. Good riddance.

Since nothing had really changed, I can spare you the boredom of the details of our return. The usual stuff still held, bad haircuts, and latecomers being subjected to internal suspension… you know, the usual.

The next morning held some surprises for us in the Aggrey chapel though…

It was like the school had gone on a hiring spree. A host of new teachers was introduced the next morning at our first assembly. So many names, so many subjects, and an absolute lack of interest on our part as students. Okay that’s not entirely true, the girls began to swoon over two new male teachers.

The first was a chemistry teacher coming in to do his national service. I hereby christen him “Macho-Hydroxide”. He was very young and kept really fit. I actually saw Macho-Hydroxide working out in the school gym once, and the guy was ripped. If teachers were allowed to take off their shirts in class, it’s safe to assume that no girl in Motown would have passed chemistry ever again.

The second… hmmmm, you won’t believe this… the second new teacher the girls were losing their marbles over was the new catholic chaplain! Yup, those dirty little girls were developing the hots for Rev. Father G, a catholic priest! Shift, Mother Mary, the SHS slay queens want your son in their very irreligious daydreams.

Fascinating? Cringe-worthy? I don’t know. I just found it hilarious. You should have heard them giving him fans when he was introduced. Chairman couldn’t stop blushing la.

Imagine how awkward confession would be. Especially since there were no confession booths in Motown, so the catholics had their confessions face-to-face with the priest.

    Random catholic girl:

    Father, forgive me for I have sinned. I have been having inappropriate thoughts about a man of God.

    Rev. Father G:

    * awkward monkey meme face *

A few more people are noteworthy: Unstoppable, Geographer, Young Money, and Gomzeh, to name a few. I don’t know if I’ll have time to uncover the origin stories of all these names. Some certainly will come up naturally, but on that day, and in that moment, they were not memorable people.

Unstoppable and Geographer, were assigned to science 4, so I can talk a little bit more about them today, but first I need to talk about Rev B’s upgrade.

Rev B was a Methodist reverend minister, and greatly feared on the campus. “Rev B is coming”, was not what you wanted to hear when you were doing the wrong thing.

There were rap songs about her. One song in particular featured the names Jet Li and Bruce Lee in reference to her. I refuse to drop the lyrics here, because even now, more than ten years later, I am still afraid, and nothing you can say will change my mind. 😅

Anyway, over the course of the vacation, the Methodist church had conferred on Rev B the high title of Very Reverend.

“What’s a ‘Very Reverend’?” you may be asking. Beats me. But I have concluded that such a person should be at least a little more Reverend than a basic Reverend. I have no idea how ‘Reverendness’ is measured, so as you can tell, I will not be able to answer any further questions on this topic. What matters is that she who was once only Rev B, was now Very Rev B, and that was already more Rev B than we could handle.

Ooooh, maybe by now she’s Most Rev B. Now that’s an interesting thought. 🤔

Okay, back to Unstoppable and Geographer.

For context, science 4, my class gave students the option of swapping out biology for geography as an elective. Because we were doing high school for four years instead of three, we were now about to start our electives, I did not care for either biology or geography, but I chose to be in science 4 so that at the very least I would have a choice. The reason I tell you this is because Unstoppable was the new biology teacher for science 4, and Geographer, obviously, was the geography teacher.

This is a good place to mention that Geographer got his name on day 1, and Unstoppable got his name a year later. Geographer wore a t-shirt with the words “Geographer” written on it for his entire first week in Motown. It was like the guy was begging us to give him that name, and we obliged.

Unstoppable came in looking like a nice chill guy; we would know his wild side a year later when he was offered the position of housemaster. As for geographer, he came in as an over-zealous low-enforcer, and rather turned into a nice guy a year later after he was made a housemaster. It was like they were the opposites of each other.

Initially, I decided to do geography—I had heard horror stories about biology—but I changed my mind within ten minutes of encountering Geographer. Here’s how it happened:

In science 4, biology and geography share the same slots on the timetable, so biology students leave at that time to have their lessons in the biology lab. As the biology students were leaving for their first elective biology class, Geographer walked in. The dude was obviously “honam pɛ job”. Apparently, he was looking for ways to prove himself to the administration as a hardworking person so they would accelerate his movement out of Katanga, the rundown male teacher quarters, and move him into one of the bungalows as a housemaster. So he was always looking for work to force students to do, with the hope that some administrators would see all his hard work; and by “his hard work” I mean our hard work.

There were about fifteen of us left in the classroom who had decided to do geography. As soon as geographer entered the class he pointed to three of us at the back and said, “Come out here. Hurry up! Hurry up!”

I thought we were in trouble for something.

We followed him outside to the back of the form 1 block, where there was a pile of dried up branches from some tree pruning that had gone on a few days prior to the reopening of school.

“Gather the branches and put them in the bin”, he commanded gruffly, as if we owed him money and this was payback.

Not a good start for human relations, but it was just a few branches, right?

We gathered the branches and stuffed them in the bin which was propped up against the wall, but the bin was soon full, and there were still some branches on the floor. The branches were a bit prickly, so it wasn’t fun work, but now the bin was full, and we began to dust off our hands to get back into the classroom. We had done our part, hadn’t we? I mean, the people who cut the branches themselves obviously had a reason for not stuffing them into the bins themselves.

“Hey hey, where are you going?” he demanded.

I shot him a look that said, “You can’t possibly be talking to me.” But with my mouth I said, “The bin is full.”

That should have been enough, right? We weren’t about to use classroom time to search for another bin to gather his precious branches. Even Palm Sunday wasn’t this stressful.

He thought about what I’d said for a few seconds, then he said, “Don’t be lazy! Press them down with your hands.”

This time it was Archie, my desk-mate who replied, “But sir, they are prickly.”

“What is prickly? Don’t be lazy!” the man retorted. He stepped forward to demonstrate how to press it down, and just as we expected they pricked him and he gave up the demonstration.

This time, the look I gave him said “Sagurrrr!”

He thought for a few more seconds and then looked at me like he’d just figured out the cure for AIDS. “You, you’re tall. Use your legs.”

Now that was the dumbest thing I’d heard all day, and it was just 8 AM; but I needed to get this guy out of my hair.

The bin was quite tall; about midway up my torso, so there was no way I was going to be able to raise my leg that high. We had to tilt it, and as we tilted it the branches began to fall out. While I pushed down with my sandaled foot, the branches began to scratch my exposed leg. I complained, Geographer called me lazy, and after five minutes of this, we still couldn’t get all the branches into the bin, but he seemed satisfied with the amount we got in.

I won’t lie, midway through that ordeal I thought about taking my foot out of the bin and sticking it up his… well, as you can tell I was not enthused.

As soon as we were done, he asked us to get into the classroom for that first geography lesson. As soon as we entered the classroom I grabbed my newly assigned geography notebook, cancelled the word “Geography” and replaced it with “Biology”.

I walked out of the classroom and headed for the biology lab. I’d had more than enough nonsense in my first ten minutes of meeting this guy. NO WAY I was going to spend the next three years sitting in his class.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I ended up studying biology in Unstoppable’s class instead of geography like I had initially planned. I was one petty little brat.

PS.

I know I still haven’t explained how Unstoppable became Unstoppable. That story will be told another day. But that day is not today.

It sure feels good to be back!
